"Boon Flair Seat Pad, Brown",I decided to buy the brown pad for the Flair chair because I've become lazy and didn't want to keep wiping the caca other kids would leave behind. Now the pooh is barely noticeable except for a distinctive smell which usually makes me laugh as I see kids parents trying to figure out where the smell is coming from.,4,1
"Rover Gear Tiburon Backless Booster Seat Bag, Black","Makes handling, carrying and airline checking a booster seat much easier.  Also doubled as a useful roomy beach bag for towels and such during our trip.  We had to drag two booster seats, so loading them into these bags, with a couple of other bulky items slid on top(wetsuits!) opened up space in our suitcases for the usual travel items.  We were able to check them as kiddy car seats, rather than luggage, which helped on the baggage allowance.",5,1
"Rover Gear Mclean Stroller Gate Check Bag, Black and Green","This travel stroller bag is wonderful!  Kept our Chicco Liteway stroller clean and safe on our last flights to and from Florida.  This will get lots of use over the years and is totally worth it.  Very well made and durable, quickly and easily stores away in the little stuff sack.  Some reviewers complained that airport personnel mistakenly sent their stroller to the luggage carousel instead of bringing it to the gate, but we had no problem.  ""GATE CHECK"" is written large on the side of the bag.",5,1
"Rover Gear Greenwich Travel Stroller Bag, Black","We bought this to gate-check our Maclaren stroller, it is very well padded and heavy duty.  If you have an expensive stroller it is a good investment to protect it if flying a few times, the cost per flight becomes negligible.  We didn't buy the Maclaren brand bag based on the reviews of it falling apart after one or two uses, and not being as well padded or made as this one.",5,1
"Rover Gear Chelsea Automobile Seat Back Protector, Black","This is a must have if you have young children!  Easy to install, covers nicely, and is not cheap or plastic looking like others on the market.  I would recommend this item to anyone wanting to keep their car seat backs clean!",5,1
Sassy A - Z Letter Links,"We love links in our house - fun by themselves or to attach other toys to highchairs and strollers. These are bright, colorful, and very sturdy. I do agree with some of the other reviews that a few of the letter's openings are larger than others and come apart too easily. Also not the best for teaching letters, but useful after letters are easily recognizable to the child.Overall, the regular oval links work better for linking, but these are still fun and I don't regret the purchase. My daughter loves to play with them, shake them around, and of course chew on them.",4,1
Sassy Mini Sports Rattle Developmental Toy,"My little one has played with this rattle ever since he could grasp it. Of course, right to the mouth. This rattle is not painted so I don't have to worry about any flaking. He is always excited to see it come out of the toy bag.",5,1
Sassy Mini Sports Rattle Developmental Toy,I have purchased this brand before and it is almost indestructable. It is the perfect gift for former soccer players for the new baby.,5,1
Sassy Vibrating Teether Developmental Toy,vibrates very easily compared to other vibrating teethers i have puchased. would have been cuter if the clear circles were different colors,4,1
"Athena Daphne, Kimberly Crib Changing Table Pad",The product came just as it looks.  Too bad the strap was not attached to the pad.  It came with nails and screws.  I am not going to mess up my dresser by screwing holes in it.,4,1
Sassy Hello Baby Phone Developmental Toy,It's a cute rattle for a great price.  I bought this for my newborn and it keeps her attention.  It's not annoying like other rattles.,4,1
"Kathe Kruse Organic 14&quot; Baby Cuddle Plush Toy, Dog","This has got to be the softest toy in the entire world. We received this as a gift from my mom for our son. I don't know if it is from being organic or what, but this is literally the softest toy I have ever felt. My son loves to cuddle with it and it goes everywhere with us. There is some sort of coarse material in the legs that gives it some weight (just enough) and the rest is filled with plush material.I'd recommend this for anyone. Even though it's a little on the expensive side, it is so well worth it. You've never, ever felt a stuffed toy this soft! When my son rubs his face on it, I never worry his skin is going to get scratched and irritated. Plus we have taken it everywhere with our son and it's been dropped, stepped on, kicked, thrown up on, etc. and every time my wife washes it, it comes back looking like brand new and always stays soft.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Precious Planet 2 in 1 Diaper Bag, Blue","The title for the review of this diaper bag kind of sums it up. Bought this bag for my daughter and her eyes lit up when she saw it. It is very colorful and fun and really does hold a lot of all that baby """"stuff"""". The bag is not so big as to hurt your shoulder. Highly recommend this one to any  mom who doesn't want to pack around everything but the kitchen sink! Lots of fun!",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Wearable Blanket Applique, Elephant, Small",Keeps my son warm @ night & he isn't able to kick it off.  Light enough for summer with footed jammies underneath.  We keep the house at about 74 or 75ish at night.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Wearable Blanket Applique, Elephant, Small","These are the best wearable blankets. We've had another brand, but these are by far the best. They wash great and last forever. Love that they zip down so the zipper is by his feet and not his face. It keeps baby comfortable when he's little and then keeps little fingers from unzipping them when they're older!",5,1
"HALO SleepSack 100% Wearable Blanket Applique, Elephant, Small",I purchased the first sleep sack according to the weight requirements and it was huge! I had to return it for a smaller one. I would recommend ordering one size smaller so your baby can't wiggle out of it or it fall off of your child.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Wearable Blanket, Cream, Medium",I love rocking my little one to sleep in this minky fabric.  It is so so soft and cuddly which is perfect for these cold nights.  I still don't feel comfortable putting blankets on him so this keeps him warm and sets my mind at ease. I wish I had bought this one earlier.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Wearable Blanket, Cream, Medium",We keep my daughters room at 69-70 degrees overnight put her in a pair of pajamas and this sleepsack. She sleeps through the night and never feels too hot. The few times we didn't use the sleepsack and turned up the temp to 73 she didn't sleep all that well so perhaps the sleepsack adds some extra comfort that she likes.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Swaddle, Pink, Newborn",it is very comfortable and I like it very very much..  it was my pretty doughtars lovely cloth...  very sweet blancket,5,1
Bearington Baby - Blessings Lullaby,I bought three of these lambs as a keepsake for 3 of my grandhcildren who sang Jesus Loves me for their Great-grandma's funeral.  They sang like little angels.  They keep this on their beds to play when they go to sleep at night.  They were tenderly kind to my Mother.  This made a lovely keepsake.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Swaddle, Cream, Newborn",I use this product every day. Easy to wrap my baby on it. This is very important specially overnight. They come in cotton for summer and a thicker material for winter. My baby sleeps on it very night.,5,1
"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Swaddle, Cream, Newborn","The Halo SleepSack has very soft fabric, and is perfect for babies that want to have arms in or arms down. The zipper is a nice feature for quick changes",5,1
"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Swaddle, Chocolate, Newborn","I received an identical blanket at a baby shower and loved the soft, cozy material so I knew this sleep sack would be perfect.  It's roomy enough for my little guy to grow with.",5,1
"Manhattan Toy Beads Wood Rattle, Classic",Baby at 6 months does not play with it for very long. His friend who is 2 years old really liked playing with it the other day tho,4,1
Dr. Seuss Cat In The Hat Stacker,"This was a Christmas present for my son (he was about 1 yrs old when recevied) and he still plays with it at 18 mths.  Wish he had this toy at about 6 mths, he would have liked it then too.  I like it because it is soft and I have washed it on gentle/delicate cycle a few times and it is still holding up well (even though it doesn't say machine wash it was fine).  He liked to teeth on the soft rings and likes pulling the rings on and off the stacker.Fun stacking toy, a little pricey but good toy.",5,1
Dr. Seuss Cat In The Hat Stacker,I love that this ring stacker is plush and soft instead of the usual hard plastic. The colors are very vibrant!,5,1
"Manhattan Toy Pull-A-Long Friend, Puppy","This was a gift for my 21-month-old daughter.  She loves dogs, and she loves this toy.  I love that the paint and finish are non-toxic.  The wheels roll smoothly, and my daughter likes that the dog's head goes back and forth when she pulls it along.  I think it's the perfect size for a pull toy.  The rope is a bit short, but I just tied a piece of ribbon to make it slightly longer.",5,1
Dr. Seuss One Fish Stacking Blocks,Adorable. Every child will love stacking them. Nice photos and words on the side of the boxes. I would buy again.,5,1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue","These are very soft and look cute. After one washing and drying on a very low setting, they do shrink quite a bit. They still seem to be big enough for an infant, but may continue to shrink or may even start to curl on the edges with more washings.",4,1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue",These are the perfect baby wash cloths - small and thin. Not sure why people are faulting them for being small and thin. I like that they're thin because then they're great to use for things like wiping baby's face and eyes.,4,1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue",Awesome deal and great buy! I love the colors and patterns. Most of all I love that the product is under $6.,5,1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue",These wash cloths do the trick.  They are inexpensive and easily replaceable.I use them for light cleanups for the face after meals (travel friendly) and they are soft to use in a bathtub.They do fade very easily but I don't expect them to last forever.,5,1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue","I needed small washcloths to clean my LO's bottom for cleaning up during diaper changes.  I thought the 100% cotton ones couldn't be beat (from the spa silk towel and washcloth set), then I purchased a set of these to try out.  LOVE THEM!!!  These are great for cleaning baby's bottom - use a wipe to get the major stuff, then use these washcloths (soaked in warm water and wrung out) to get the detailed work done.  The are small and thin enough to get in the nooks and crannies, but absorbent enough to retain enough moisture to be effective.  They have a soft side and a ""rougher"" side.  Terrific.  I'll probably eventually start using in the bath, but they are terrific for diaper changes right now.  I purchased two more packs to make sure I have enough on hand.  Well worth it for my use!  Highly recommended for this use!",5,1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue","We use this Washcloth for everything. Feeding time, bath time, clean up spills time.You name it and we have used this Washcloth for it.Just remember - One side is rough and the other side is smooth.FYI - The design side is the rough side.",5,1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue",These are nice and soft. We love these because they are soft on the babies tender skin. Wish they were a little larger though.,4,1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue","Gift also. but not much you can say about a wash  cloth, they look fine thru the package. Wash cloths are well wash cloths",5,1
Bugboo Exploratory Soft Book,"This book has captivated my 6 month old, providing stimulation with many colors and textures for her to explore and enjoy!",5,1
"Spasilk 100% Cotton Hooded Terry Bath Towel with 4 Washcloths, Beige","the product, was in excelent conditions and was on time. thanks a lot.SpaSilk 100% Cotton Hooded Terry Bath Towel with 4 Washcloths, Green",5,1
"Spasilk 100% Cotton Hooded Terry Bath Towel with 4 Washcloths, Beige","The towel and washclothes are very rich and absorbent. They make washing baby and drying him easy and enjoyable. I loved them so much that I order 2 more. For the quality of the product, this is a bargain.",5,1
"Spasilk 100% Cotton Hooded Terry Bath Towel with 4 Washcloths, Beige","Bought this towel washcloth set because I liked the frogs.  We use it with each bath and it works fine.  Launders well.  I do like other thinner, softer baby washcloths to use for washing on our 5 week old daughter.  I use the wash cloths from this set to wet and place on her abdomen to keep her warm in the bath (they are thicker, larger and a little rougher).  I think these wash cloths will work well for washing her when she is bigger.",4,1
"Spasilk 100% Cotton Hooded Terry Bath Towel with 4 Washcloths, Beige","it's 100% cotton, so it absorbs great and is gentle to baby's sensitive skin. though the blue whale seems to be a little scratchy on the inside where it touches his forehead. i might cut the thing off.",4,1
Lamaze After-Pregnancy Perineal Healing Spray,"i had a 3rd degree tear with my first daughter and used a spray that was medicated that the hospital gave me, this time around i wasn't going to a hospital so i knew i would need to by something and turns out i had a 2nd degree tear this time so i did need it....this is what i chose and it helped a great deal....only down fall it that it is hard to get it to spray when you hold it upside down which is the easiest way to spray it where you need to...i didn't even use a half a bottle and used it for 4 weeks :) so i think a smaller size with a differnt pump and it would be perfect",4,1
Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover - Aero,I LOVE this cover. It is very discreet and I don't have to worry about my baby pulling the cover off when she is wiggling. I love that I can look down to quickly see her. I never have to worry about an embarassing exposure with this cover. I also like that it is not as hot as a regular blanket. The case it comes in is great to keep the diaper bag organized.,5,1
Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover - Aero,Amazing product for MomsI find this nursing cover to be VERY stylish and work wonderfully. It is big enough to cover everything yet comes with a small pouch it folds into for storing. The fabric is a nice quality and I am very happy with this and would recomend it over any other nursing cover.,5,1
Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover - Aero,This nursing cover is very durable. It washes easily and has been stuffed in my bag tons of times. The fabric and rigid neckline have held up well. The storage pouch helps keep my bag organized. I like this style because of the ruffles.,5,1
Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover - Aero,I feel so secure when using this cover up. And I love the opening up top so I can see my daughter. I have had it no for a little while and it still stays open.,5,1
Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover - Aero,"This cover works wonderfully for both mother and baby, and is discreet and attractive.  The boning in the top lets mom see baby and lets baby see mom and have air circulation.",5,1
Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover - Aero,Highly recommended. Convenient and easy to use for nursing. Very cute pattern and little ruffled pocket on the side for burp rags or other odds and ends.,5,1
Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover - Aero,"I love this product...I can feed my daughter anywhere without any hassle or problems..Before I bought this product, I used a blanket and it always fell..This product is so convenient..",5,1
Bink Link Pacifier Attacher By Fruitabees - Skully,"Ordered this quite a while ago, my son loved it more than the pacifyer itself!  He still uses it as a toy, his face lights up every time he uses it!  Go figure, it's cheaper than a toy too!",5,1
"The Original Woombie Cocoon Swaddle, Big Baby Glow","This seems like a great idea, but somehow my daughter is still able to get her arms out by her neck, which only makes her more frustrated. She can come out of Kiddopotamus swaddle as well, so now I'm putting her in both at the same time, with Woombie being on the outside. Works great, and she sleeps like a, well, baby.",4,1
Breast Pump Adapter ( Multi-Pack),These attach to my Medela Pump in Style pump so I can pump a higher volume of milk in one sitting. It is nice not having to change the bottle out during a pumping session.,4,1
"Real Nappies Cloth Diapers Essentials Pack, Crawler Size, for babies 6-18 months, 17-30 lbs.",I was on the fence about trying cloth diapers.  I'm so glad I tried these.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money and many of the other brands are very expensive.  This system works well and is easy to use.  We use half cloth and half paper diapers.  This system definetly paid for itself and has saved us money.,5,1
"Real Nappies Cloth Diapers Essentials Pack, Crawler Size, for babies 6-18 months, 17-30 lbs.","Great starter to transitioning to exclusive cloth diapers!!  So affordable and soft!  Our baby is not born yet, but we  look forward to the savings and eco-friendliness that cloth diapers allows us to have.",4,1
"Real Nappies Diaper Liners, 100 Sheets","This is the 3rd liner I've tried. It seems really flimsy, but it holds the stool really well. I will purchase again. BTW: my baby is 8mo old and on solids/nursing (for those of you who understand how the stools change with age/food).",5,1
Vibrant Butterflies Nursery/Kids' Room Wall Sticker Decals (Glow in the dark),"Got these for my 3 year olds room, they are perfect.  You can actually remove and replace without having to worry about taking paint off of the wall.  Just wish that there were more then one sheet of the butterflies.  that would have made it even better.",5,1
Vibrant Butterflies Nursery/Kids' Room Wall Sticker Decals (Glow in the dark),I bought these stickers for my daughter's new room and they are great! I have had to remove them and re-stick and have had no problems with them. I would recommend these wall stickers.,5,1
"Real Nappies Cloth Diapers Birth To Potty Super Value Pack, Over 100 Items For Babies 6 lb to 40+ lb","This is my first baby and first time experiencing cloth diapers. Everyone in my family and my friends thought I was nuts for wanting to use cloth diapers but after all the diapers I have changed, I can't imagine all the money we would be spending on disposables! However, there is more work involved. I soak them in the washing machine, with some stain remover, while I wait to have enough to do a load. (I do this because by daughter is breastfed and we don't use the liners yet. The stools are too loose and the liners are useless until she starts getting more solids in her system) When it comes time to start a wash, I add some baking soda and pre-wash them before adding a regular detergent, and vinegar, and doing a regular wash. Afterwards, I dry them on a low heat setting in the dryer and then iron them flat. Like I stated before... a lot of work. But I definitely think it is worth it. We still use disposables when we are at daycare (could not find one that was willing to use the cloth) or out of town (for ease) but use the cloth at home consistantly. I really like how the Real Nappies give you so much in one package. I was concerned before I received them about how they would work out because they cost so much money, but they have really turned out to be easy to use. I do suggest buying a couple of snappies to use on the inside cloth diapers though. I bought these later and have found them to be incredibly useful. I am very happy to know that I have paid my dues and have enough cloth diapers to last me for my daughter's entire diaper years. No need to think about what size I will need next and how many of everything I need. This package has made cloth diapering very easy for me. Especially since I am a new mom. The only thing I wish would change is the velcro. They are kind of a pain and I worry about them coming undone when she gets to a crawling stage (another good reason to use snappies). Snaps would have been nicer but I understand that the velcro makes sizing easier as she grows.",4,1
Tub Tattoos: Monkeys,"Shipping was fast, and the product does what it's supposed to. Haven't had any problems with any of them not sticking or coming off. It's a super easy solution to fix any slippery surface. I definitely recommend this product!",4,1
"Quickzip Organic Crib Sheet Set, White","Since crib mattresses are very snug by design, changing the sheet is a big hassle:  pry and lift the mattress from the crib, change the sheet while taking care to ensure proper slack at each corner, then shove the mattress back in.  Repeat for your second baby.With Quickzip sheets, you just unzip the dirty upper portion, then zip on a clean one.  Very quick and easy.  The zippers are big and sturdy, and covered over by extra fabric overhang.Less material to wash equates to more efficient laundry (carrying, load size/soap/water, folding, storage).  We have 3 sets of these for 2 cribs and a few more top sheets for laundry rotation.  They fit fine overColgate Eco Classica III Dual firmness Eco-Friendlier Crib mattress, Organic Cotton CoverandAmerican Baby Company Organic Cotton Quilted Crib & Toddler Crib Size Fitted Mattress Pad Covers, Natural.",5,1
"Quickzip Organic Crib Sheet Set, White","I have been using these for two years. I like them because they don't bunch up and have stayed white through a number of accidents. It's a little difficult to fully change because I have to heave the heavy mattress over the bed rail, but if you're just changing the top, it's a breeze.",4,1
"NUK 2 Pack Designer Pull BPA Free Silicone Pacifier, Baglet, Size 2, Colors May Vary",AAA pacifier for your baby. I bought 3 packs of 2 each and color did not vary (blue and green) neither you are able to choose them.,4,1
"Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer Bags, 6 Pack, White",great for travelling.  just a bit small.,5,1
"Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer Bags, 6 Pack, White","I used up all my Medela Sterilizer bags and decided to try another brand. The material is the same, the number of uses per bag is the same. These seem to have more space. I can put more items in these bags than I can in the Medela bags. I think these cost a little less than the Medela so I think overall this is a better buy.",5,1
"Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer Bags, 6 Pack, White",SO these sterilizer bags were a lifesaver for me at work. I kept my pump parts in my office and would just use these sterlizer bags to clean my pump parts in our office kitchen. These are so easy to use and you can use them each 20 times! These are a lot more affordable than the other brands and the you can feel the quality of the bags as soon as you open up the packaging. Great product and shipped FAST!!,5,1
"Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer Bags, 6 Pack, White","These are so easy to use for sterilizing! We go camping often and I use these to sterilize while away rather than bringing my big round plastic microwave sterilizer or boiling water. Each can be used many, many times. I am a huge fan!",5,1
"Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer Bags, 6 Pack, White",Pretty sturdy and nice. I think you might be able to use them a little more than 20 times for sure!,5,1
"Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer Bags, 6 Pack, White","i bought these bags to store, transport and clean my pump parts.  they are great to use for a working mom!note the bag barely fits 2 pump horns & bottles, and some brands fit better than others (lansinoh fit in the bag no problem, medela lactina kit is a tight squeeze).for those who can fit a lot in the bag-please give us details on how you do it!",5,1
"ShadyBaby Sock Monkey Stroller Parasol, SPF 50+ Stroller Umbrella - 24&quot; Diameter",This umbrella can be adjusted in almost any way making taking a stroll in the sun very doable. While walking simply move the umbrella a bit to keep baby shaded.,5,1
"ShadyBaby Sock Monkey Stroller Parasol, SPF 50+ Stroller Umbrella - 24&quot; Diameter","I saw this on the Shadybaby website for $35 but got it for $20 here.  Perfect condition.  you just clamp onto any bar on the stroller, tighten and open the parasol.  It has a small bendy party that allows you to angle the parasol.  It's perfect for our walks and the sock monkey is a cute design!We use it everyday, literally.",5,1
Original Sleepy Wrap Baby Carrier (Light Blue),"This wrap takes a bit of work to get on and get baby situated, but is by far the best carrier/wrap we've tried once the baby is in it.  Baby is securely and comfortably snuggled to the chest, and the wrap distributes the weight over both shoulders so is really comfortable to wear.",5,1
Original Sleepy Wrap Baby Carrier (Brown),"I Bought this wrap when my baby was two months old and he loves it . It relaxes him and it's comfortable enough to wear for long time periods. It's one size fits all unlike some so I can wear it , grandma can wear it , etc.  It's the best priced wrap I've seen and the company doesn't charge extra for different colors or prints. I would definitely recommend this .",5,1
"Trend Lab Ultra Suede Hamper, Pink","We bought this for our daughter's bedroom.  You know, to try and keep the clothes off the floor.  Amazingly, it worked!  There is no assembly except to hang the outer part on the frame, and then do the same for the removable inner liner.  The fabric is soft, resists mildew and looks great.",5,1
Kinderville Little Bites Cups Set of Four,"We got these cups for our two toddler boys and for us, they were the perfect size. Yes, sometimes we refilled them a lot, but if we'd given them anymore, they would have picked up the whole thing and spilled it. We always prefer to err on the side of less food and less mess and possible seconds (or thirds).Lovely to have something that isn't going to break when dropped. For me, these didn't smell like plastic (well, they Aren't plastic) - there was no bothersome scent to me.And the boys loved picked a color to drink from (wearing a green shirt? get the green cup). I do wish the ""blue"" was a little more blue.Our biggest problem with these is they are nice and squishy. This was fine for our older child (I think he was 2.5 when we got these?) but our younger son is a mess lover and food scientist and would sometimes squish the cup sides together when full, causing a spill.We were willing to live with this occasional mess for the benefits though. We did finally trade them out for some Duralex Picardie glasses in the 7.5oz size to match my husband and I's bigger glassware. Yes, they are glass, but very break resistant and the boys have yet to break one of theirs, though nothing is magic of course.These glasses live on in the bathtub however, as a favorite bathtoy. I love that it's something non-plastic that won't mold in the tub and the boys love stacking and pouring and all kinds of things with them. And the new baby loves to teethe on them. In fact, I was reminded to write a review as I was adding them to our wishlist.",4,1
Kinderville Little Bites Cups Set of Four,"I have the lidded storage jars and just love them.  I make all of my own baby food, and these are a great tool.  They hold up well in the dishwasher and I have used them as small adult dessert dishes and my 3 year old son likes to use them as well because they are so bright and fun.  I believe they will hold up well into the future.",5,1
Kinderville Little Bites Cups Set of Four,"I bought these bowls for my seven-month-old daughter and am very happy with the purchase. I bought them after realizing the cheap plastic bowls I bought for cereal and baby food may have harmful chemicals in them, found these, and am glad I bought them! They are so much better than plastic because they heat well in the microwave, are easy to clean and don't stain, even with baby food carrots. Although they are flexible, they seem to be sturdy and unlikely to slip on a high chair tray. The most important thing is that I don't have to worry about chemicals getting into her food. I plan on purchasing more silicone products in the future in an effort to get away from plastic!",5,1
Kinderville Little Bites Cups Set of Four,wow- these were so worth the money !  awesome- my 3 yr. old loves them. they're sturdy and he feels like a big boy- he even refills the cup himself from our filtered water. love them and will tell others or buy them for gifts !,5,1
Kinderville Little Bites Cups Set of Four,"All our friends know us by being safety contentious with the products we use on (diapers, wipes, etc.) in (food) or with (cups, bowls, etc.) and these were recommend to us by some friends. We absolutely LOVE them... and so do our kids!",5,1
Fuzzi Bunz Organic Cotton / Fleece Double Sided Wonder Wipes - 10 pack,"I really love these wipes. They are so soft and luxurious, who wouldn't want their tushie wiped with these? My child has very sensitive skin, and these are so gentle on her. Yes, they do shrink a bit after you wash them, but they are still plenty big enough to get the job done. These are the best cloth wipes I have found.",5,1
"Dream On Me 2 Position Baby Bather Bath Tub, Yellow","I really wish I had found this bath tub sooner. I'd purchased 4 other bath tubs, ranging from various infant tubs to the Leacho Bath 'N Bumper, and my daughter has outgrown them all. However, she can't sit up unassisted for long yet, so I've been struggling to bathe her in the adult tub. This tub solves all of my problems!!!! It is big enough for her, and whether I put her in the lying down or sitting up position, the ingenious grooves keep her steady!!! I love everything about this tub, and again it would have saved me a lot of money had I found it sooner.",5,1
"Dream On Me 2 Position Baby Bather Bath Tub, Yellow",we are using this every day and we love it. it fits perfectly to our tub and the kids love taking baths in it.,5,1
Graco Jump N Jive Doorway Jumper with Interactive Musical Mat,"We are very happy with this purchase. Pretty easy to put together. I did have a little trouble with the seat because the directions are very basic. You have to fold the seat over the top of the seat, slide the rim through the slats THEN attach the buttons... I was trying to slide the seat up from the bottom without folding over the top to attach the buttons which did not work. Was very frustrated till I realized the problem. Our 14 wk old LOVES the jumper. He loves to kick his legs and now he can jump all around... I would like for the door clamp to have a locking feature but the clamp does feel secure. I also like that it is very portable.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","When new moms ask what products they 'must have' this is always my first recommendation.  We used this almost every night for 6 months with our first baby.  He slept right next to my bed which made it so convenient to nurse him when he woke in the middle of the night.  I slept better because I didn't have to go across the house every time he was hungry.  He also wasn't a fan of his crib; he either didn't like sleeping flat or just liked being a little more snug when sleeping.  Either way this was the solution!  I love that is flattens easily and is lightweight and portable.  I can rock him to sleep when I'm doing the dishes!  The cloth is soft and spot cleans nicely, and also easy to remove and toss in the washer.  Then fits back on just like new.  I highly recommend this for new babies!  And even with using it for as long as we did it still looks brand new for baby #2.  Holds up very well.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","We bought this on a whim for our baby girl, and haven't regretted it for a moment!  She is always so content sitting around the house in this sleeper, and sleeps well in it when she takes naps.  It is a great height to keep her on our level when we are sitting on the couch.  We tend to drag it all around the house from room to room to keep her entertained as we do things.  She is completely happy kicking and rocking in it as long as she is wherever we are.  We love it!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow",We got this bed as a gift and considered taking it back because we thought we would only use it for the first few months but my son is 11 months old and we still use it when he has a cold and he loves to sleep in it. It is also very easy to take with us even in our Honda Civic Hybrid (small trunk).,5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My daughter sleeps so well in this sleeper.  Such a great buy.  Keeps her at an incline position, which she loves.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My son refused to sleep in his crib from birth.  After days of struggling we finally got him into our bed sleeping on his Boppy pillow.  That was a great arrangement but I started to worry about him sleeping there and when washing the cover, discovered the BIG tags saying how BAD it was to let your baby sleep in their Boppy pillow.  I found this sleeper on Amazon and it has been AMAZING.  He sleeps for hours in here and is out of our bed, allowing me to wake without stiff neck and arms from cuddling with him all night.  However, at 6 months and 20 pounds he has figured out how to push against the leg part and push himself up, making it no longer safe.  I am devastated and with his continued refusal to do anything but nap in his crib, my husband and I are looking for a new version of this.  An absolute life saver.  We've taken it on trips (disassembled and fits in a suitcase) and has awesome sleep even while away from home.  Buy this.  Cheap at three times the price.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I love this little rocker.  It is very lightweight and portable and the incline is perfect for my reflux cursed newborn.  The rocking component is very basic and simple, but once he is asleep, no need for rocking.I like the seat belt feature as it will make this purchase last a little longer than a few months.He likes to sit in it as well as it gives him a better view than flat on his backThe reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are these....1. I find it a little cumbersome to collapse (though maybe should be a pro for safety reasons, but I am thinking of my use)2. I do wish it had a vibration feature of some automatic rocking button (but the simplicity I am sure keeps the price low)All in all, I am happy with this purchase, but would not say it is a must have.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My twins went from waking every 2.5- 4hrs.  To sleeping 6-7 hours at night!  My baby girl slept 9 hrs one night. They are 3months old.  They usually don't take naps. Now they take several a day, or one long one.  It has been a lifesaver.. and I can actually sleep now, and get housework done !  I see a difference, rocker vs crib ! But I still like for them to spend time in the crib...But find that they are less cranky after waking up in the rocker. I bought one to try it out. And purchased the second one within a week of receiving the first.  Love it Love it Love it !......................Now my babies are 9 months old, they do not have FLAT HEADS, they seemed to have slightly mis-shaped heads before they started using this. I religiously turned their heads at first but later gave up. When lying flat, they would resist head turning. In this crib, they would stay asleep and it was easy to turn the heads. My girl would also vomit or spit up on a daily basis since the day of her birth. This seemed to help that too.  I also washed the covers regularly.. never saw any type of mold...and I would know, I live in a humid area and am allergic to many types of mold!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","This is the best baby item we had for our son.  He spent many a night in this.  It is super comfortable (I suspect), serving as an instant swaddler.  The cloth is super soft and washes easily.  It also travels very easily, and went with us everywhere.  I buy this item for all the new, expectant moms I know, and they grow to love it also, though it doesn't take long.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","Love this seat. I used it for my now 18 month old and have bought one for my sister and two for gifts for baby showers.  My son used this till he was 5 months.  It is all he would sleep in at night since he had reflux problems.  I like that it sets higher up off the floors than bouncy seats and is easy to pull from room to room.  We also took this when we went to visit friends or was gone overnight. Reading on here is the first I have heard of mold problems but I regularly cleaned mine, by removing the cover and washing and wiping the plastic parts down with lysol wipes.  I never saw mold of any kind on mine and I always cleaned and inspected it everywhere.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow",Yet another gift we got off our registry.  This product was used all the way up until my son turned 6 months as he was starting to sit up so it wasn't safe for him to be in it anymore.  It's easy to assemble.  I put it together when I was 7 months pregnant.  Our son slept in this until 4 months old due to his acid reflux.  I do agree with other reviews on how it's rather hard.  What I did to fix this is take the cover part off and put blankets under there to soften it up.  I do see that they have come out with newer version of this that has a softer base to it.  We truly loved this product so much that we bought another one.  One to keep upstairs and one downstairs.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I had looked for this item at other places, but did not find the color or style I was looking for.  I then looked on Amazon and found exactly what I was looking for.  I bought it as a gift and my sister in law was completely satisfied with the quality of the cradle.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","Best baby purchase EVER. Reflux or not, it is a must have. It also comes in handy for colds since it elevates the baby enough to breathe. The first three months would have been miserable without it!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","This newborn rock'n play sleeper has been fantastic.  My daughter has slept in it for nearly every nap and night since she was born and loves it.  It is also super easy to fold up and bring somewhere - we had to stay in a hotel for a weekend and it was so convenient to fold it up, throw it in the car and travel to the hotel - also have brought it to friends and families house during visits (much better than the bulky pack n plays I used to tote around with my first born).  Highly recommend!!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","Bought for our 3rd child, all have had reflux issues and disliked sleeping in cribs at first.  He fell asleep the first time I put him in it!  and now, at nearly 2 mos, he's sleeping in it exclusively, day and night.  At first he would only sleep in his car seat, but I got tired of lugging that in and out of the car, I wanted something to just stay inside the house.  The Rock & Play sleeper looked like it might work as an alternative, and it definitely does. Seems to hold the baby at a similar angle and depth like a carseat. lightweight, easy to move anywhere around the house.  I love this thing and wish I would have had one for my first two children!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","This item is great for our baby with reflux to sleep in....however it came smelling heavily of i assume the plastic packaging... so much so I could smell it across the room even after hours of it being set up.i had to take the cover off and wash it but the fabric on the base of it cannot be washed or removed...so it still smells.the only other complaint is that i wish it rocked a little more...it doesnt rock much at all and you end up hitting the feet of it on the floor and startling your baby.There is no vibrate or music on this like a typical bouncy seat, which was fine with me...but my 4 year old was looking to turn something on for her sister :} so i thought I'd mention it, just in case you would assume also.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","Our baby loves this and sleeps in it all of the time... easy to carry to different parts of the house and can rock with your foot while you watch tv, read, or are doing something of that nature",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My son will not sleep in the crib for longer than 20 minutes. He doesn't have reflux and he likes to play on his back, so I have no idea why he won't sleep that way. I tried everything I could think of, including a vibrating matt that goes under the mattress, with no luck at all. I was really at the end of my rope when a friend suggested I buy this. First night I tried it I knew it was going to be worth every penny. My son has been using this now for about a month and a half with great results for both of us. My only complaint is how little padding it has. I put some layers of felt between the cover and the hard plastic back for some extra cushioning. I think that problem is address with the more expensive versions.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I have never reviewed anything before. This little bed was SO GREAT I felt compelled to. Bought this for my third baby. Really wish I had it for the first 2. He slept so well from day 1 in this bed. Also, it was the perfect height and portable enough to keep bedside or take camping with us. Would highly recommend this. You will not regret this purchase!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","We bought this sleeper so that the baby can sleep without us having to take him back upstairs to the crib. It was so comfortable the baby slept for hours.It can fold when not in use and the padding is easy to remove for cleaning.There are several variations of the sleeper out there and they all have the same features. If you are looking at this one, don't hesitate to buy.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I wish i had this item when i started having babys 24 years ago. I just had my 6th child. I bought this ltem on a whim, not really knowing if i would use it or not. I have used it more than anything else. Since birth she has napped at home and at family homes. we have taken it on pic-nics and camp-outs. I put it in the bathroom when i shower and the kitchen when i cook and the porch when im relaxing. It is so handy and mobile, i think everyone should have one of these. My baby is 6 months old and was having trouble sleeping in her crib at night, so i put this beside my bed and she sleeps safe and sound. I have given two of these as gifts and will continue to do so.I am saving ours for when our grandbaby""s come to visit. LOVE IT!!!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow",i purchased this for my baby girl London and she loves it! of chorus with plenty of tummy time during the day this bassinet was perfect for my baby girl. especially on the nights that she had to be close to mommy and daddy without being in our bed :),5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","This was a lifesaver!  I received it at my baby shower and I'm so glad I did!  My daughter is an extremely high needs baby and for months she wouldn't sleep if she wasn't on me or my husband.  She also had very bad reflux and the doctor recommended we sit her up for at least 30 min after feeds, which is hard to do with late night feeds.  Eventually, after about 2 1/2 months, she would sleep in here for naps if swaddled tightly.  Eventually she would sleep in here through the night.  The crib was just too much space for her and she would scream her head off the second you put her down.This rocker is incredibly easy to move from room to room, not to mention fold up and take along to family or friends.  It was just what my daughter needed before the transition to the crib.  She is almost 5 months and will still nap in this when we visit family.  My mother and mother-in-law both purchased one for their homes so we didn't have to worry about bringing ours since we're there so often.I would HIGHLY recommend this product for any baby!  It's convenient, folds pretty flat which was great because I have a very small apartment, and gently rocks itself with baby's movement.  My daughter figured out how to push herself up to rock herself back to sleep.  I was afraid this would make the transition to the crib harder, but instead, when she was ready for the crib it just happened.  And her first night in the crib she slept through the night!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","after countless hours of researching bassinets for our baby while pregnant i came across this. i'm not into the frilly, ruffly kind so this definitely caught my eye. it looked rather simple, which i liked, but i was unsure if it could really be something my baby could sleep in each night. boy am i glad i went ahead and registered for this. i love that it is not flat since my baby tends to spit up a lot. also, the rocking motion is heaven sent. i couldn't imagine putting my baby to sleep in something that did not rock. it's also so lightweight that i can easily be lying down in bed with one arm out rocking my baby to sleep. it's light weight also makes it easy to move from room to room or take places in the event mommy and daddy go somewhere overnight. as a first time parent i highly recommend this!! you will not be sorry!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","Great product, used it for naps and rocking the little one to sleep before we transferred to the crib. (Our kid does not like to be swaddled). Never had a mold or any issue, will surely use for next baby.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I bought this for #2 when he was born back in March.  He is 4 months old and still uses it a few times a day and occasionally at night as we are transitioning to the crib.  He had mild reflux when born and the incline helped tremendously with his pain associated with the reflux.  The other major benefit is that it is lightweight and extremely portable!  I send it to my mother-in-law's house to use when she babysits while I work.  It is very stable and my toddler who likes to help ""rock"" the baby, cannot tip the rocker over.  Some reviews warn of flat head or shoulder problems, and we have had no such problems.  All in all, it is well made, I have had no issues with it and it has been $50 well spent!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I bought this chair for my second child.  We used it for naps and some overnight periods until he was about 4 months old.  Fantastic product!  He didn't like being swaddled, but he did like how cozy this was once he was cuddled up inside of it.  It was also a good height - I could see him when I was laying in bed without lifting my head up off the pillow.  We've since loaned it to a friend whose baby has reflux and she says it is much easier to use this than the carseat to keep him slightly upright when sleeping.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! This is by far the best baby product on the market. It offers a sleeping environment for babies that is portable and safe. It is great if your baby has a cold or needs to sleep slightly elevated because of reflux. Many people complain that their children get flat heads because of this product, but if they are following safe sleeping guidelines and placing baby on his/her back to sleep, they will get a flat head no matter where they sleep. I love how convenient this is, I took it everywhere with me and did not loose a lot of valuable trunk space. I absolutely recommend this product.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow",This has been a lifesaver while our little one has had a cold.  Easy to clean and goes anywhere.  This is a must have for new parents.  I bought a Tiny Love toy bar to add on to it.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I bought this product based on reviews from people I know and the reviews here on Amazon, and I was not disappointed. My baby girl started sleeping through the night the second night home from the hospital. We didn't move her out of the Rock 'n Play til almost 9 months old. She is 11 months now and does wake up once a night several times per week, so I really do attribute the Rock 'n Play to her awesome sleep prior to the move to her crib.I did listen to other reviews about the spot where the head rests being hard, so I bought the Boppy Noggin Nest as some others had suggested and had no issues with flat spots on her head what-so-ever.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","We registered for this and were lucky enough to receive it. If we hadn't, this would have been the best $50 we spent. This is my first baby and I was trying to avoid having a ton of gear. I love how she can sleep in this and hang out in it during the day. It is easy to move so if she falls asleep in it, I can move it with her in it without having to wake her. I really like how if she starts getting too wiggly in it, it will rock itself slightly so she is able to put herself back to sleep if needed. We have recommended this to everybody who comes over and sees it",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","We got this baby sleeper for a week at the grandparents - he loves it.  He now sleeps in this instead of the wood traditional cradle in our room b/c he sleeps quietly, soundly, and we do too!  I recommend it.  Easy to put together by yourself, nice travel convenience (not necessarily for flying but to fold up and put in your car), our 2 month old boy - who is quite tall for his age - loves it.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I love this sleeper.  I can move it to any room I need to easily.  It's easy to wash.  I've been using it for 4 1/2 month.  I used the bouncy seat with baby #1, but I like that this seat is higher- less bending and leaning over.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","We absolutely love this product.  We have twins (boy & girl).  They sleep in this every night.  One has reflux and the other has a narrowing of the nasal passage.  Due to both of their situations they need to be elevated while sleeping.  Since you are not suppose to put pillows, etc in cribs and with them while they sleep this is the best solution!  We received one as a baby gift and I ordered the second shortly after.  They are very easy to pack and travel.  We take them with us when we go visit relatives, etc.  They take up less space than a pack N play and work wonderfully!  I would suggets these to any parents whether they child needs to be elevated or not.It is a must!!!!!!!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","After reading the reviews of this product on amazon I was intrigued and decided to purchase it. It has been awesome! After I set my newborn daughter in it, she doesn't fuss or cry (unless she is still hungry). She is sleeping so well at night that I have to set an alarm to wake her up to feed. I only wish that I had this same sleeper for my other two kids.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","When Our newborn was born, he had acid reflux, and this was the perfect solution -  he loved to sleep in this.  I did read other reviews on this so i was aware that the back of it is hard, i slid a blanked under the material (there is a slot where you can do this) so it is softer and my baby hasn't developed a flat head, however the doctor did notice at his 2 month check up that he always turns his head to the right and struggles to turn to the left.  The doctor says this is because the angled sleeper causes my baby to sleep with his head turned to one side because of the shape of the sleeper, and i should turn his head to the left when he sleeps.  I moved my baby into the crib for long naps and sleeps when he was 2 months, he is now 3 months and i just use this as somewhere for him to sit when we are having dinner or if we need to put him down somewhere (other than his activity mat) for a short period of time. His neck is much better now",4,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I went ahead and bought this sleeper and I am so glad I did!  After my c-section I had trouble climbing into the bed so I put the sleeper next to the couch.  Later on, we were able to easily move it to the bedroom.  My son loved to be rocked in it and the angle enabled him to see me when I put him down into it.It's lightweight and portable, so it was perfect when the in-laws came to visit and decided to stay in a hotel almost 2 hours away or when I took my son to the babysitter's house while we were having work done at our house.  I think this would be wonderful for grandparents/other people the baby frequently visits to have handy at their house as well because it folds and can be put away.  It easily fit into the trunk of my car.The yellow one comes with a little rabbit with a square of fabric attached and it rattles a little.  My son (now 8 months) loves this little toy and it's the perfect size for him to hold.I did read the warnings about the babies developing flat heads or their heads tilting to one side so I bought a Snuzzler to go with the sleeper.  Problem solved.  When our son was a newborn, we put the entire Snuzzler in with him and we were still able to buckle him in.  When he got older, we just used the part that went under his head.  It helped keep him snug and on his back.Overall this is a wonderful item, especially for those with limited space available, babies with reflux (a problem we thankfully didn't have), or for overnight stays with the baby.  It's affordable too, so I would also give this at a baby shower.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My son has never been much of a sleeper since birth and he would only sleep on us or in his car seat (in the car) the first few weeks of his life because of his reflux. I bought this because of the reviews and he slept great in it! He slept in this the first 3 months but he did not like the straps that held him in so when he was big enough to start wiggling, we transitioned him to his crib. I kept this in his closet ""just in case"". Well the last 3 nights my now 5 month old has had a bad cold waking him up every 20 minutes. We tried all the humidifiers, suctions and nasal sprays but after about 20 minutes he was congested again. So last night I brought this out and strapped him in, he slept great! For the price, I would have this on hand for any child even without reflux but it has been a godsend for us.I will say that my son has never liked to just ""chill"" in it but he is extremely active and doesn't really sit anywhere for long... It would have been even better because of it's portability if he liked to sit in it during the day.We LOVE this product, thank you Fisher Price!",5,1

"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I bought this product for our newborn son because it sits nicely against the bed and he likes to sleep on an incline. What I don't like about the product is I thought there was a setting or some kind of mechanic device to make the &#34;rocker&#34; rock, I didn't realize you have to physically make it rock on your own.

Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock,I was so worried my 2 and 1 year old would get there fingers caught in the bi-fold doors as their mommy has done it a few times and it was not pretty. These were the perfect solution and they don't break when you forget they are there. My husband and I would often forget they were even there and force the doors open with all our might and they would pop off but it required quite a bit of strength and the boys could never seem to get them to open so these were pretty amazing and if we live in another home with those annoying doors I will definitely be purchasing these again.,5,1

Here and there a little will soak thru to the other side, and only when I go over 4+ hrs. between feeding/pumping at night. Even then it wasnt that bad, and I had the same experience w/ the disposables leaking.They are somewhat discreet, however if you are wearing a thin bra and thin shirt you can kind of see the outline of them - but this is true with any disposables.Yes they sometimes stick to you and this could be a little uncomfortable if you are just beginning to nurse and things are sensitive, but give yourself at least a month for things to ""toughen up"" and then try these out! Now when they do stick, it doesn't hurt and I have had no issues w/ fuzz being left behind.Pros: SoftWash wellSuper cheapEco friendlyCons: The only con is perhaps they could have a super thin waterproof layer in  there to prevent any leaks",5,1

They keep you fairly dry, however when they get soaked through you do need to change them out to feel comfortable. That said, even when they got soaked through it never leaked through to my shirt.  I have been using these for three months and am happy with them.  They hold up well in multiple washings and have maintained shaped.",4,1
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","These pads, once washed are excellent for wearing around the house.  For the first two months of breast feeding, I would wear these inside a disposable pad since milk may leak through.  I found these to be softer on my sore nipples than any of the disposable pads.  Plus, at night or when I'm at home, I would much rather use something reusable.I accidently wore these to a pilates class and was pleasantly surprised that they stayed in place.  At night they move around some.",4,1
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","Let's start with the fact that I am lucky to have an abundant milk supply and have nursed my daughter comfortably from day one.  With that, I leak.  Especially when my milk let's down.  These pads are soft, comfortable and make me feel protected from the embarassment of leaking in public!",5,1
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","I am not a heavy leaker, but I do have problems when I'm out of the house or when I am late feeding or pumping. I find these pads to be the most absorbent reusable pads I've tried. I've never tried the disposable kind, mostly because these worked well enough. As my son is starting to stretch out his nighttime feedings, these pads have been able to handle extra leakage while I sleep. Sure, they will soak through, as they have no moisture barrier, but I can comfortably go 5-6 hours without worrying about that.",5,1
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","I'm a pretty heavy leaker, but these work great! I had been using disposables despite the fact that I cloth diaper, then when I went to order more pads I realised how stupid that was.From the second I put them on I LoVED them! I didn't think disposables were uncomfortable until I knew the feel of a cloth Pad against my boobies. My love dwindled a little after I put them to work and they would absorb ok, but would only in a little area right around my nipple and eventually soak through, it wouldn't utilize the whole pad for absorbency. I don't know if thatAre sense, but after washing them several times this problem went away. So make sure you wash them a few times before putting to heavy use.I admit, I should have known to do this since that's what you're supposed to do with cloth diapers as well.The only thing I don't like about these cloth pads is that somehow they slowly disappear, like socks, so I still have to order another package every couple months, but they still end up being way cheaper ( and more comfortable than sposies.If your a heavy leaker (like me) these aren't absorbent enough for night use, I use Bamboobiea Overnight for at night.Also, of they're  wet they are cold when you put them back on after a feeding, but they warm up if a matter of seconds and if they're really wet you should be changing them anyways.",4,1
Allison Diaper Bag in Black (As Shown),"This bag is AMAZING, and buying on amazon on sale saved me $90! I love this bag and I spent 3 weeks researching diaper bags of the regular and designer variety to find the perfect one that fits my style and looks like a purse as well as works like a diaper bag. It's well worth the money and the quality is excellent.",5,1

Mod Stripes Aqua/choc 10CS,"I have not actually used this bedding set yet because we do not have the crib set up due to our living situations (hence only four stars), but after taking out of the packaging it seems to be good quality. I am not quite sure I will use the mobile or the wall hangings, but they are a nice addition if I do choose to. Why I really wanted to do this review though is because I was a little surprised to notice that there is a grid on the side that has diamonds. I can tell looking at the pictures now and knowing that they are there, but could not before I saw it in person. Thin blue lines connect each point of the diamonds to one another. It doesn't make a difference to me, but it may to someone else.",4,1
"Summer Infant Mother's Touch Baby Bather, Bubble Fish, Large","I used the heavy plastic tub for my daughter when she was a baby and so when my son came along my boyfriend picked up this seat and me and my mom were skeptical about how well it would work.  We have used this seat since the day my son came home from the hospital and it has been great.  At 8 months old my son is still using it and loves it. It stays in place in the bath tub no sliding around.  I have seen other reviews that stated that the baby sat awkward in this seat and I totally disagree my son sits kind of laying down angled up and he sits there without slipping around. He is an extremely active baby and yet he stays in the same spot with no slipping and can easily be flipped over and lay on his belly at the same angle to wash his backside. Also at 21 pounds and 28 3/4 inches long my baby still fits comfortably in this seat with no sagging down of the seat. As for other peoples comments about the smell of this seat I completely disagree with that also.  We have used this seat many many times (every time my son has a bath--at least 4-5 times a week) and have never had an odor to it at all.  Once my son outgrew the head insert we washed it and hung it up to dry and no smell to it at all and as for the seat itself we always take the seat part off and hang it up to dry over the shower and then fold up the other part and put it away. We leave it hanging up until the next time we use it and never smelly. We wash it every other week and it has never had this odor...all I could think of after reading the other negative reviews about the smell is that other people after using this seat just fold up the entire thing including the seat part and allow it to dry all folded up instead of completely drying hanging up therefore causing it to mildew and get smelly. Also not washing it on a regular basis would also possible cause this as well as just leaving the seat together to dry in the bathtub without taking apart everytime.  This product is easy to fold up and store, dries very fast and easy to assemble everytime.  Highly recommend this seat. Couldnt find a better alternative unless you are lazy and dont like to take apart to hang up everytime...",5,1
Carter's 4 Pack White Long Sleeve Bodysuit (3M),These were a gift and I had a hard time finding them in local stores.  I wanted the long sleeves to go with winter sleep sacks for a new baby and you can never go wrong with Carter's clothing for babies and older children too.  Amazon to the rescue again. The new mother was delighted!,4,1

"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack",We looked at many hooks to hang our diaper bag from the handle of our stroller and I'm thrilled that we decided to go with these metal hooks.  They've held on great and don't even flinch when we hang a huge diaper bag from them.  Thrilled with our purchase.,5,1
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack",I love our BabyJogger City Mini but the one thing that was a nuisance was that due to the handle design I didn't have a place to hang a small bag.  These are perfect for that purpose and now I love our stroller even more.Something I was originally concerned about was whether or not the hooks would stay in place (I thought perhaps they might slide down the handle once there was something hanging from them).  I'm happy to report that has not been the case! They have stayed exactly where I put them.I have purchased these for friends and recommend them to anyone who has a single handle stroller.,5,1
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack","I have the Bugaboo Cameleon stroller, which doesn't have any hooks.  They are great for hanging the diaper bag and when you go shopping, you can hang the bags on these hooks and are hands-free!",5,1
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack","I love these stroller hooks!  They're the best!  They're easy to use, don't slip and hold your bags, dry cleaning, toy, etc.  No stroller is complete without them.",5,1
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack","I purchased these for my UppaBaby Vista stroller, and they are amazing.  From my super heavy purse, to my dog's leashes, these hooks can handle an extraordinary amount of weight and force.  Love them!",5,1

"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack","These are some amazing hooks that don't budge, carry a ton of weight and look stylish too.  I like putting my diaper bag on it so I have easy access rather than reach down into the carriage.  Worth every penny.",5,1
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack",Very happy with this product. It looks exactly like the picture and is as easy to use as described. Would definitely recommend it.,4,1
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack",I bought these to use on my sons wheelchair.  It fits great and works so much better then the mommy hooks I have the slide down the handles too far and carry my purse so low it sometimes drags on the wheels.  I love these hooks!!  They stay on real tight and don't slide around and easier/faster to get my purse on and off.  Love them!,5,1

"Think King Soft Buggy Cup for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker,  Black/Silver",I love my think king cup because I put snacks in it for my toddler. They don't fall out of any holes and when it is empty the cup squishes up with the folded stroller! Love it!,5,1
"Think King Soft Buggy Cup for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker,  Black/Silver","we use this on the stroller to help give us an extra space to put this like our keys when we go walking or our cell phone. Doesn't work as well for drinks.  So no, if you want to put drinks in there...then this is not for you..",4,1
"Think King Soft Buggy Cup for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker,  Black/Silver","This is a fantastic cup holder! I have two and I love them!  I use them to put my keys, phone, sunscreen and of course my water bottle! My daughter has one by her side on the stroller for her water and all the little things she finds in the park! They work great!! nothing has ever fallen out and I like the flexibility of the fabric much more than the hard plastic ones, which I've had and broke. Also you can strap them on practically anything, like the side of the bunk bed!!",5,1
"Grobag Home Grown Organic Baby Sleeping Bag 2.5 Tog, 0-6 Months","We purchased the 2.5 tog 6-18 month organic cotton Grobag for $79.99. It is the same design as the one in the 0-6 month image, solid cream color with no stripes. This surprised us, because the product image was different than what we received, but we were still very pleased with the look and feel of the one we got.It is very heavy duty, extremely soft, and the zipper doesn't bunch up when you wash it like cheaper zippers sometimes do on less expensive baby bags. We use the Grobag at night when the temperature is in the 60's and it keeps our baby boy very warm.Worth noting: He is 20 pounds (at five months old) and this fits him well with plenty of room left for him to grow. If you have a big baby, you might want to start with this size rather than getting the smaller one.Overall, we're extremely pleased with this product. It seems a little pricey, but it holds up very well with frequent washing, and we expect to be using this for many months, as well as for our next baby.",5,1
Earthentree Organic Waggy Pull Toy,"Our family loves Earthentree toys!!!  My daughter loves them and so do all of her play date friends.

If you are looking to buy something special and not plastic this is the toy for you!",5,1
"Baby Jogger 2010 City Mini Single Stroller, Black/Black","We bought this stroller because my wife is only five foot two and all the other cool strollers are too heavy for her to manage.Pros:1. Best all purpose stroller under 25lbs. This stroller does a good job on everything. Not a great job on any one thing.2. Very durable, I am hard on equipment, we've had this 21 months and it is still solid.3. Very manageable. Not as manageable as a mall stroller, but easy to throw in the car, and navigate through an airport or mall.4. Love the deep pocket under the seat. Often we have two softball gloves, two balls, coat, and some baby items in there. Also love the deep mesh pocket on the back.Cons:1. Jog-able but not a real jogger. I jog with this stroller but have to lift the nose to get over that one-inch bump on the corner of a handicap accessible curb. Grass and gravel are bumpy (baby likes that) it's light and pretty agile. If you don't lift the nose when hitting a bump you can tip forward at an angle which is a little scary until you build a habit of keeping your weight back.2. The back angle is adjustable but doesn't come forward/up enough. My baby was uncomfortable between 12-18 months. He wanted to sit up to see better. it was only a moderate annoyance for him. Now he is 21 months and loves the stroller.3. It would be nice to have a cup holder or hand brake.Summary:I have more cons than pros but the pros are a lot more significant for me. Because of the light weight and mid-size I don't believe there is a better one for all stroller out there. It is a lot like an all mountain ski.",5,1
"Baby Jogger 2010 City Mini Single Stroller, Black/Black",This stroller is EXCELLENT.  Easy to open and close... lots of room for stuff and for a growing child.  I also bought the bar for front and tray which come in handy!  This stroller is also very durable!  Smooth ride all together too! I had a Bugaboo and McClaren... which are now in their boxes in teh basement thanks to this one!,5,1
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small","This sleep sack is all too adorable!  It's soft, durable, and just the right length.  It's light enough for summer use with no concern of overheating.  I really enjoy the aden + anais line of products!",5,1
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small","Not sure why this only had ok reviews. We've used it nightly for more than two months and it's holding up great. It has so much kicking room and is perfect for the warm months. I'll probably use it during the cooler months too with a heavier onesie underneath. I like that the zipper top is covered so it doesn't have the metal zipper top against his neck. This is my favorite of all the sleep sacks we've tried, and they run bigger than the sizes suggest, so it will get plenty of use to justify the price.",5,1
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small","I gave this sleeping bag as a gift to my daughter , she loves it.  She  has other muslin products made by Aden + Anais, they are well made and so soft.  Will be purchasing more of these products , definitely worth the money.",5,1
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small","I was hesitant to buy this based on reviews about rips and the zipper breaking, but we've had this in heavy rotation for almost four months and have no complaints! It's true the zipper is cheaper than most others (plastic) but this hasn't caused any problems for us.It is so soft, and has gotten even softer with washing. The mod turtle print is cute - a good gender neutral option. Size medium says 6-12 months, 15-24 lbs / 7-11 kg. My daughter has been wearing this since she was 7 months, 18lbs and is now 11 months and about 20.5 lbs and it fits very comfortably. I think she will outgrow the length first, but that seems to be the case with every sleesack (and all sleepers and onesies too).Even though I bought it for summer I think we'll actually be able to keep using it this fall and maybe into winter since fleece sleepers aren't quite warm enough here (Minnesota) by themselves (well, depending on the kid and house) but it's too much to layer them with heavier sleepsacks. We've been using this over her regular clothes a lot for naps too and I think that will continue to work at least through the fall. This summer we used this sleepsack with just a onesie at naps or a lightweight cotton sleeper at night.",5,1
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Burpy Bib, Butterfly Patch","Soft, absorbent and convenient. I especially love that it can be used as a bib. My first daughter had severe reflux and I am so disappointed I didn't find these sooner!",5,1
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Burpy Bib, Butterfly Patch",they contour to your shoulder/neck and really keep baby from spitting up all over your shirt. They also turn into bibs later. Better than the more expensive aden + anais  burp cloths that can unravel in the wash.,5,1
Bi-Fold Door Lock &quot;Slide-Lok&quot; from Mommy's Helper -- 2 PACK,"I did  not install these myself, but I will say that they work perfectly without much of an eyesore. However, when we have our shorter friends over, they are not able to reach the top of the bifold doors as easily.",4,1
Kidco Universal Outlet Covers in White - TWELVE (12) Pack - Works with Standard Single or Decora Double Screw Outlets plus BONUS (2) Outlet Plugs!,"I must admit that I have been dreading the day my little one becomes mobile since my passion for decorating nearly equals my passion for babies and most baby proofing items are not attractive.  So when I saw these- I thought it was a win, win situation.  When looking at the new outlet cover in place, the eye is fooled into seeing nothing different than usual. At the same time, I found these safer than the standard outlet plugs, which are impossible for me to remove but seem to be no problem for my friends' babies.  Having said that, I probably have over 75 outlets in my house & it is not economical to use these covers on all of them.  The 12 and 25 pack on Amazon are far better priced than if bought for nearly $4 a pop in the store. I put these on all the ground level outlets in the baby's room and in both our living rooms, where she will be spending the most time.  Standard outlet plugs for everywhere else.Pros:1. Attractive. Deceives the eye into thinking you haven't even baby proofed the outlet.2. Safer than standard outlet plugs as you have to slide the cover over to expose the outlet plug.Cons:1. Geniuses who made them made them thinner than standard outlet covers.  This worked out ok for us except for one outlet I could not use it on because the outlet cutout was larger than the new plate.2. Over time, some of the heavier plugs seem to come a little loose. We haven't had the problem of them falling out like some reviewers but I do check them from time to time.3. Expensive.  Not economical for use on every outlet in the house unless you have money to burn.",4,1
"ERGObaby Organic Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Blush Beige",even if you don't use the ergo carrier this was really helpful as a barrier when putting the baby to sleep.  we put him in it while he was dozing off so that when it came time to put him in the crib he didn't feel much fingering on his skin or through his clothing so he didn't wake up from the transition.  we also used in it our moby and just as a warming layer at chilly times.,5,1
"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural",The infant part of the ergo is slightly awkward to get used to and positioning your baby can be difficult at first but overall my baby loves being in it and appears comfortable once settled.,4,1

"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural",This insert worked perfectly for my first baby and we used it almost daily for walks or even to be close while doing chores around the house. It washes and dries well - holds it s shape. The only complaint I have is that I could never figure out how to make the adjustable closure stay synched after I snapped it in place.,5,1
"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural","the insert is easy to use and seems pretty comfortable for our daughter to hang out in. So far, she haven't spit up on it so I dont know how stain resistant it is yet but the this came out fine after the initial wash",5,1
ERGObaby Infant Insert (Heart2Heart Galaxy Print).,"I bought this after receiving the Ergo carrier as a shower gift.  And while I cannot say enough good things about the Ergo carrier, it is literally useless to you without this insert if your child weighs less than 15lbs.  But the insert is easy to use with the carrier, works great and provides the necessary support your little one needs in those first months.",5,1

"Playtex Toy Story Insulator Cup - 2 pack, Colors and Styles vary",I've used Playtex brand sippy cups for years and years with my 4 children during their toddler years. The colors are vibrant and the variety of designs are very nice and my children always loved the characters and colors. I never had an issue with leaking cups or flimsy lids.

I've found cups hours later under the coffee table, opened them up to find that the liquid was still cold.  These are the only sippy cups I'd ever recommend.",5,1

"Playtex Toy Story Insulator Cup - 2 pack, Colors and Styles vary","These cups work great for me and my 20-month old son.  Love the graphics, and the fact that they are double-wall insulated.  As for the twist and click aspect, I really don't understand why some people are having trouble with this, as it is quite simple - the cup has a plastic ridge that when the lid is twisted over it, will ""click"" as it passes over the ridge.  It is a soft noise, but no matter, as the lid also has an arrow on it - when the arrow is over the line imprinted on the cup, then the lid is properly sealed and leak-proof.  The cup has only leaked twice on me (after about 2 months use) - once because my son untwisted the lid so that it was not properly sealed, and once because the valve had not been placed in securely.  Very happy with my purchase.",5,1
"Playtex Toy Story Insulator Cup - 2 pack, Colors and Styles vary","I love these cups because they stay pretty chilled. They are a little hard to clean, I have to use q-tips to get in the nooks and crannies of the lid. Overall, good cups though.",4,1

Baby Einstein Around The World Discovery Center,"The research and development team did a fantastic job on this play center! My sleepy 4 month old was immediately drawn to all the fun toys on as soon as I placed him in it. The only thing I find odd and dislike about this play center is that it says not to use if your child is 30 in or taller. My guy is tall for his age (25.5 in) and on the lowest setting, his feet don't touch the bottom! If all his weight is shifted to one side, his toes touch. That part confuses me but other than that it's excellent, a lot more lightweight than it looks so it's easy to move with one hand and they toys are fun for mommy too! ;) I highly recommend this play center. The height thing is what keeps me from giving this that 5th star!",4,1

Baby Einstein Around The World Discovery Center,"This product was a baby shower gift (not the one I registered for), but I was pleasantly surprised at how well my daughter plays/ entertains herself in this exersaucer. There are a variety of toys they are able to choose from and the seat swivels so when they want to go to the next toy, they are able to swivel themselves to a new perspective. She loves to chew on the toys and plays w/ the buttons the most. It's very sturdy construction and easy to clean ie wiping w/ clothes in between uses. Being a single Mom, I find this product VERY useful so that she may be in the same room w/ me, but I know where she is and she has something to keep her occupied. The only thing that I think she doesn't like about it is that it doesn't bounce. (Her sitter has a different brand that she can jump in and she tries to jump in this one too!!!)",4,1

It fits his crib mattress perfectly.  The blanket is a little on the thin and light side, but right now it's warm so I approve. In the winter I can add in a fleece blanket, which I'd probably do anyway.What an adorable set, that has held up to months of washing frequently without fading or falling apart.  A really great purchase!",5,1

It actually helps me pump more milk per pumping due to the fact that it holds the flanges tighter against me and prevents breaking suction as easily. Also, you can actually do something other than hold the pump while pumping. Such as read, play with your little one, or even (gasps) drive. Yup. when your desperate youre desperate. This is a handy thing to have around for pumping Mom's.",5,1

"Medela Easy Expression Hands-Free Bustier, White, Small","Due to tongue tie issues with my son which prevented him from nursing properly, I became an exclusive breast pumper.  I knew about these hands free pumping bras but for some reason it took me 5 months to actually buy one. Why did I wait so long? Now my hands are free to type at my computer or to play with my son on the floor and pick him up if I need to, or to move around the room without stopping the pump.  If you breast pump for any amount of time, get this (or one like it!).I am a size 36C-D and I ordered a medium. With the Ameda Purely Yours breast pump it holds the flanges nice and snug. I don't have any problems with it feeling loose. I like how I can just zip it up over my nursing bra. It does take a little longer to get set up and get the flanges positioned properly, but having my hands free is worth the extra time. And yes, I am pumping as I type this review.",5,1
"Medela Easy Expression Hands-Free Bustier, White, Small","This works great, but the sizing is a little tight.  When starting to nurse I was about a D size cup and the large was REALLY snug.",4,1
"Medela Easy Expression Hands-Free Bustier, White, Small","I ordered the black bra because I didn't want the breast milk to show up on the white. It fits great, I ordered the XL because I have F-G cups and it holds on tight but you have to sit upright and sometimes you have to pull it up as it can push down. The wholes aren't exactly lined up with your breast but you can adjust it. The only difficult part about it is first getting it on, the zipper tends to get stuck but that could be because I'm an Xl! and then also when your taking it off, the milk drips on your pants sometimes because you have to unzip to take out the breast pump acessories and it can get kind of messy, but overall great price and great value!",4,1
"Medela Easy Expression Hands-Free Bustier, White, Small","I was hesitant in buying the bustier and was going to cut holes in a sports bra, but then decided that at work I am not going to change into a sports bra to pump. The bustier works great and fits over my nursing bra. Although everyone says it runs small, I still bought a medium since I wanted to wear it over my nursing bra. My non pregnancy bra size is 34 b, I'm breastfeeding and my current size is 34c. I have had zero spills.",4,1

"Medela Easy Expression Hands-Free Bustier, White, Small",For the first 6 months after my baby was born I had to exclusively pump milk for him. I wish I had discovered this earlier.

Children's Nursery Room Wall Decal - Baby Circus,I know this decal from a mom's picture that she posted in a forum. She showed her son's baby room. Many moms saw the decal and ask where she bought. She gave the link to Amazon. I click the link and found lots of decals. I bought the baby circus and jungle adventure. My son is 10 months now. He really likes them and starts to point the animals and shows everyone. So funny. Also it is easily to stick and peel off.,5,1

"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster, Carbon","Can be challenging to fit in smaller back seats as headrest can be hindered by the C-column.  That being said, we have 2 of these flanking a Britax Marathon in the back of our 2000 Subaru Legacy wagon--it's a tight fit, but it works.  A well made, substantial seat.  Thankfully don't know how well the side impact head rests work in a crash, but wow they are great for napping in the car.  Highly recommended.",4,1
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster, Carbon",This carseat is awesome. My 4yr. can sleep in the car without any head having. She can rest her head comfortably.,5,1
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster, Carbon","We did a ton of research before purchasing this seat.  It was really the only one in its price range with a nice amount of padding and comfort and it got great safety ratings and reviews.  If you have a smaller car and multiple passengers, it doesn't take up much room which is great.  It fits snug and perfectly into the back seat of our Nissan Cube.  It looks very cool with its race car engineering as well.However, my soon to be 8 year old son is tall and his shoulders barely fit under the side impact head protection.  He is very slim but feels crowded. We ordered it online so we could not see how he fit in it prior to purchasing.  We thought we could separate it into a bottom only unit, but it turns out that you cannot...I think for most people the seat would be a fantastic purchase aside from the height issue that we encountered.",4,1

"Lifefactory Silicone Nipples Stage 2, 2 Pack, Clear","I have used the Stage 1 version of these nipples. The Stage 1 nipples lasted me the entire 3 months without the need to replace them. I have already begun using the Stage 2 nipples and have been using them for 3 weeks. The quality is the same as the Stage 1's. I use the nipples for at least 8 feedings for each 24-hr period, which means I have used the Stage 2 nipples a minimum of 168 times already. Needless to say, the nipples are superb in quality, and these are the best in the market. If only the nipples were marked somewhere to indicate the stage. However, it is not big deal as I am able to distinguish the difference in the stages when I wash the nipples. The Stage 2's show a faster flow than the Stage 1's when I run water through them during the rinse process. Great product!",5,1
"Sunshine Kids Radian65 SL Convertible Car Seat, Champagne","We bought this seat for my older son when he outgrew his standard plastic car seat.  This is a great, great seat.  It's slim, strong and easy to install.  My son was in a minor accident in my mom's car recently and the EMTs at the scene were even impressed with the seat.  My son is fine, and you can be we'll be keeping both our boys in 5-point harnesses for as long as we can.",5,1
"Sunshine Kids Radian65 SL Convertible Car Seat, Champagne","we bought this for daughter number 5.  i just got fed up with those infant carrier/seats that would ""rebound"" in a rear impact.  this and the britax are the only seats with a tether that is useable in the rear facing position.  this seat is awesome.  it has really plush high quality fabric/padding.  it sits low so toddlers and bigger kids can get into it easily (unlike the graco nautilus seats we have).  the only problem is that even on the smallest snuggest settings, the harness straps are not quite tight enough on our 9 pound baby.  she is getting bigger fast, and we rarely leave home, so it isn't a huge issue.  just beware that there is no way this seat will safely work for small infants in spite of its labeling for 5-65 pounds.",4,1
"Sunshine Kids Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat, Bentley","I don't normally write reviews, but I felt like I had to write something for this product. This car seat is awesome, and dealing with Sunshine Kids is even better!I ordered the car seat from Amazon, and it arrived quickly and in great shape. Unfortunately, while I was unpacking it I did not realize that energy-absorbing (EPS/EPP) foam is basically Styrofoam, and I tried to pull out a piece of it that was underneath the seat base. When it snapped and I saw that the rest was glued on, I realized that it was structural to the seat.I emailed Sunshine Kids to ask what I should do, and even though it was completely my mistake they sent me a new piece of foam with instructions on how to install it. If you're going to drop several hundred dollars on a car seat that you plan to use for 5-6 years, it's very nice to know that you're dealing with a company who will stand by their product and provide excellent customer support.Great customer service aside, this seat is very nice. The cover is soft and comfortable, and I love how narrow the base is. We have it installed in the center back seat, and an adult can comfortably sit on either side of the carseat, which would definitely not be the case with most of the other convertible seats out there. Best of all, our daughter loves sitting in it. Every time we strapped her into her infant bucket seat (Chicco Keyfit 30) she would cry and try to get out after a few minutes, but she doesn't mind sitting in this seat at all, and we're actually able to drive for more than a few minutes in the car without tears.As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, this seat is very long, and you may have to push your front seats up quite a bit to get it installed correctly rearfacing. We've installed it in the center back seat of a Honda CRV, and while the driver has plenty of room (because the center backseat is slightly off from center, the carseat actually isn't behind the driver's seat at all), the front passenger seat doesn't have a whole lot of legroom. However, it's not terrible by any means, and my 6'2"" husband is completely able to sit up there, although for long road trips it probably wouldn't be that comfortable. For smaller cars, this probably wouldn't be a good choice, maybe something like the Cocorro would be a better seat for extended rear-facing installation. We haven't installed the Radian front-facing, but I imagine if it were installed front-facing there would be no problem with the length in any sized car.We did not find installation (with a seatbelt, our vehicle doesn't have LATCH in the center) to be difficult. At first, all the straps on the back were a little overwhelming, but after we'd done it once it's been very easy to take it in and out of several different vehicles. So far we've installed it without difficulty in a Honda CRV, a Subaru Legacy, and a Dodge Grand Caravan. If you're having difficulty with the installation, I'd recommend taking it in to a CPS technician (professional car seat tech), who can give some tips on getting a solid install even with just a lap or lap/shoulder belt. It really is very easy to do once you know how!The one real downside to the seat is that it really is very heavy. We bought it largely because we wanted it for air travel, and even bought the extra strap so we could carry it like a backpack, but after one plane trip with it we've vowed to never carry it through an airport again. It's a beast! That's great when it's installed and is protecting your kid, but as far as hauling it through an airport, no thanks. We picked up a cheap ($35) & lightweight (8 lbs) Cosco Scenera and we'll be using that as our travel seat and keeping the Radian for use at home.Overall, I am very happy with this seat and with Sunshine Kids. I highly recommend their seats to anyone who's got the lengthwise space in their back seat, and who doesn't want to use the seat for air travel.",5,1
"Sunshine Kids Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat, Bentley","The slender build of this seat allows me to fit two of them plus a third seat in the back of our civic. I like the low profile. My kids are now 6 & 9 and still using these seats. The head rest is a little tricky to adjust up, but it can be done. Probably helps to read the manual for that one ;) The company has fabulous customer service. We noticed a slight sewing defect on the cover and they sent us a whole new cover.",5,1
"Sunshine Kids Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat, Bentley",We love this seat.  We've had no problem installing it in 2 different cars.  It seems to be a very durable seat that will fit our daughter until she no longer needs any seat (booster or 5 pt harness).  I love that it can be used for extended RF.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it seems the buckle between my daughter's legs gets tight and digs into her stomach before the shoulder/chest harness is tight.,4,1

"Clek 2010 Oobr Booster Car Seat, Paul Frank Zoom Julius","I recently bought this seat in solid black (rather than the Paul Frank version), for $[...]. I must say I am very impressed by this brand new seat (I think it was released in late 2008). Can be used in a variety of configurations: full back mode (33-100lbs, height 38-57in, at least 3yrs old; backless mode: 40-100lbs, height 40-57in, at least 4yrs. Comes in various colors (pink, brown, black, plus the scurvy and colorful stripy one). Conforms to Federal Motor Standards. Not certified for airline use (because airplane seats don't have shoulder belts).Here is a list of features you will not find in the Graco popular booster seat:1. To my mind, the biggest and most important (though not necessarily obvious to parents looking to upgrade from a convertible seat) advantage of all Clek seats: LATCH. Meaning that this seat, along with your child on it, is securely planted on the back seat and cannot move around. I remain unconvinced by seats held in place only by the seat belt and the weight of a child. Both the backless Clek booster and this one with the back (Oobr) have LATCH. Oobr in particular features an ingenious extendable LATCH that will pull out to firmly grab the deepest and most inaccessible LATCH bars.2. Magnesium back frame to better protect the torso during a side impact and vehicle intrusion; enough said!3. Back seat is not only removable (the lower part of the seat can be used independently, like a regular Clek seat), it also *reclines* up to 12o. Perfect for snoozing!4. Structural headrest with deep side wings that support the head during naps, and yet do not obscure side views. The headrest connects to the magnesium frame of the back using steel rods to reduce twisting movements and improve head protection in a collision. The headrest is also height-adjustable: it has a button and several adjustment spots and can be pulled up a good 20 cm, meaning it will grow with your child. This is so well designed it looks like a regular car seat headdress in a high end vehicle.5. Energy-absorbing foam layer to absorb energy of a side impact.6. Nicely designed and easy to use belt guides facilitating a snug fit of the seat belt on the child's shoulders7. Nicely padded bottom and back that doesn't cut circulation, especially e.g. under legs.8. Performance 'Crypton' fabric: stain, moisture and bacteria- resistant. Easy to clean.9. Plastic parts, including cup holder, are high quality. In fact, 100% North American derived content! No flimsy or suspect materials here.10. Feels lightweight despite the sturdiness.Other pros:1. Ease of use- took me 3 mins to install the seat, another 1 min to buckle my son in.2. All black version looks great, with its red contrasting parts (not too sure about the Paul Frank designs, seem overstylized to me; who wants to be driving this stripy crazy thing around for the next 5 years?).3. Comes with a detailed instructions booklet that can be stored in a special place under the seat.Cons:-Price: but safety features and excellent design justify the sacrifice.-Side contour in conjunction with armrest position reported to be somewhat restricting by my son. But maybe that's the point (to keep the child from moving around).Overall would highly recommend!",5,1
"Clek 2010 Oobr Booster Car Seat, Paul Frank Zoom Julius","We bought the Clek Oobr booster seat a couple weeks ago and my almost 6 year old loves how comfortable it is. We, as parents, were concerned about safety, but after installing the Clek Oobr, it is not a concern. We have a 2011 Mercedes Benz ML350 and this seat clicked right into place. It was a very solid click!!! The headrest is right were it needs to be to provide the side impact protection. I like how the seat brings my daughter a little lower in the seat, putting her in the correct position for her height. Her previous 5-point harness car seat sat her up to high. The seat beat threads through the headrest and it is very easy to pull across my daughters chest and fasten. She quickly learned to do it herself. The only assistance I offer is tightening the lap portion of the belt after she gets it fastened. Only thing to mention is how heavy the seat it, but that is because it is reinforced for safety. It is a bit jarring when you are expecting it to be as light weight as the ones you can pick up from any of the local discount stores. This is not one of those. What we also think is of value is that the seat comes apart. I am excited to try out on the seat portion of the booster when we go to Disney this fall. The only thing is your child will need to be at least 4 yrs, 40"", and 40 lb.  The seat will allow her to sit higher on the airplane, in the taxi and any other vehicle we take that has a seat belt. I was hesitant about moving away from the 5-point harness, but after installing and using the Oobr for a couple of weeks, I have no regrets.",5,1
"Clek Oobr Booster Car Seat, Blue Moon","Was looking for the next-step seat to replace the Britax Roundabout.  Loved the Roundabout & Britax products so I went searching through their lineup but was unhappy with the installation of the Frontier and all the mixed reviews it had received.  The Clek Oobr is just what I was looking for - the highest safety rating possible with a simple installation that will likely be the last seat we need (as it converts to a backless booster for children up to 57"" and 100 lbs).  This seat is definitely the most sturdy booster I have looked at and makes the Graco booster (leftover from my first child) feel like a toy. The reclining feature is a bonus for a booster seat, but we have yet to use this feature for snoozing yet as most of our car trips are under 15 min.  You do use the recline to install the seat when using the ridged latch.  I had never seen a ridged latch prior to this seat and it was one of the reasons I was unsure about ordering it.  For all of you out there like me, I'll do my best to describe it.  Instead of the latch hooks hanging on the end of an adjustable belt that loops through the back of the seat (as in the case of the Roundabout), the ""ridged latch"" hooks are built into the base of the seat.  To install this seat, you pull the recline handle and the base of the seat towards you.  This action extends the two latch ""arms"" from the back of the seat, which you then line up with your seat latch eyes (not sure if thats the right term?) and click into place.  You can then adjust the seat to your preferred recline.  It is very easy and (I feel) even more secure than the latches on the adjustable belt because there is never any ""slack"" to worry about.  We used this seat recently in a vehicle without the latch system for the first time and although it is not as obviously not as stationary as when it is used with latch, I felt it fit much more snug than the other boosters I have experienced.  At 35 lbs and 39"" my child is at the very bottom of what is recommended for this seat, but the seat does a perfect job of keeping the belts in the correct position even on her small frame.  Only had the seat a month, but the fabric appears to be durable so I am optimistic - only time will tell.  Amazon had the best price I could find, and although it isn't cheap I feel the price is justified by the quality of the seat and the length of time we will be using it.  Definitely would recommend to others.  As always, quick shipping from Amazon!",5,1
"Clek Oobr Booster Car Seat, Blue Moon","I had read several very detailed reviews about this booster car seat.  We bought the black one for our six year old son (we had the Britax Marathon for both of our children).  Not only is it a very safe booster (love the latch system), our son loves it!  He says it is very comfortable and it does clean-up like a dream.  We liked it so much we bought a second one for our five year old.  If you have a latching system in your car, this is the only booster I would recommend.",5,1
"Clek Oobr Booster Car Seat, Blue Moon","Amazon was the cheapest place I found. This is a pricy seat but a breeze to install and my four year old can buckle/unbuckle it herself,  Safety wise it has the highest rating. I bought the color ""shadow.""

"DaVinci Piedmont Changer Chest, Espresso","My husband and I love this changer/dresser. We were looking for something that could grow with our child but also be used as a changing table without the typical changing table top. We also wanted it to match our DaVinci Espresso crib, which this does perfectly. This piece is very solid and not too difficult to put together. The only thing I wish was different was that the changer/dresser was a little longer. All in all we are extremely pleased and would recommend this product.",4,1

"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","I love these diapers. When I first started using cloth diapers I bought a pack of Kushies and one fuzzi bunz diaper. The fuzzi bunz are a lot more money so I wanted to try both. I quickly found out why they cost more. Simply put, they rock. No leaks, the mess is an easy clean up if you use the Kushies disposable liners. When there is poop, just flush the liner and it leaves a relatively clean diaper. There might be a little poop on the corner where the liner isn't covering, but that is only with a softer stool.The only complaint I could have is when I bought the first Fuzzi bunz diaper (it came with a liner that fit inside perfect). When I just recently purchased my last five Fuzzi bunz diapers from amazon (the liners are smaller, almost like they were made for a smaller fuzzi bunz diaper).  They still work fine because I change very often. I have 11 diapers and I would like to have about 5 more so I can get away with washing every other day.Also... side note... I don't use these at night because I did it for one night and my son had a little diaper rash and he never has had any problems with diaper rash. So disposable at night and cloth during the day works great for me.",5,1
"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","I purchased three large sized fuzzi bunz because my two year old son barely fits into the one sized fuzzi bunz.  These are huge! Now I know lots of moms like to exaggerate on how big their sons really are- mine is two but 36 lbs and 37 inches tall (carries most weight in belly if they helps). The diaper fit fine- doesn't leak.  But he has a huge bubble butt in it. I think I will stick with one size on the biggest setting just so I can get a super trim fit! Btw, the insert in these is hardly any bigger than the big one that comes with the one sized- II can't tell them apart without holding them up to one another.. So it's not like it is going to hold more pee than the one size.  It you are looking to stuff it up though the large is the way to go.",5,1
"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","I was so hesitant to try cloth diapers, I waited untill my baby is now over 12months old.  However I will be purchasing a dozen of these and never using disposable's agian!!  These work great, no leaks!!!  Just remember to only use a tiny bit of soap in the wash otherwise soap will still be on them when they are done.  Also use the magic stick(sold at amazon) if diaper rash ever occurs (which has not happened since I've used cloth)  because you cannot use desitin or a&d with cloth diapers as it will ruin them.  Go get these!!!  Do not waste hundreds and hundreds of dollars delaying like I did!!!!!",5,1
"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","I love this diaper, it holds in pees and poops well. I've had no explosions in them. The biggest con of them is that they are a pain to stuff. They fit my child from 4lbs - 11lbs",5,1
"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","I used disposable diapers on my first child and then made the switch to cloth with my second. I was a little overwhelmed when I started researching all the different styles, sizes, and brands of cloth and decided to try an assortment.  I have to say Fuzzibunz are easy to use and care for...much easier than I anticipated.  You need to pre-wash the inserts several times to obtain max absorbency.  And you need special detergent, Rocking Green is my favorite, to wash them in (and high water levels during wash).  If you're thinking about making the switch to cloth diapers you really can't go wrong with FuzziBunz.",5,1
"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","i recently found out about these and ordered one to try out, i now have 6. I do just fine by hand washing, although I am a stay at home mommy so for those of you who wont have the time to wash every day, i would recommend getting a little more of them. When all of my fuzzi bunz came, they all had an insert that was smaller than the LARGE insert, just like one of the reviewers already said, but I think that is amazon and not fuzzi bunz.These are worth the investment, especially if you are planning for a second! I feel so much better about my carbon foot-print, and they are sooo soft. You do have to change them more often than the disposable diapers, but that is no problem. I love this product!!! and the colors they come in are sooo cute! I have all of the bright colored ones for my boy. I just wish they made a 6 or 12 pack with all of the bright colors-unisex for a better deal.",5,1
"Fuzzi Bunz Comfort Pad Regular, White, 3 Pack","I bought some of these after trying the multi-size pack. The regular size is great for medium and light days and as an everyday liner. I prefer the super size slightly because they can be all of those things plus good for overnights and heavy days.They are very absorbent, remain dry to the touch even after fully used, wick moisture away from my body into the pad, and wash easily.Feels great to use these everyday rather than consuming pack after pack of disposable maxi pads and panty liners that will live forever in our landfills after being used for only a couple of hours.",5,1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I was hesitant to get the FB one size at first because the elastic sizing options seemed complicated, but I'm a believer now!

It was super easy to adjust and fits the absolute best out of all my diapers (and I also have bumGenius, Kissaluves, Baby Kangas, Rumparooz, Babykicks, Dream-eze, and more - so that says a lot!). Most diapers are too big on my daughter's waist but too tight in the legs so the FB OS solved that problem.",5,1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I bought this diaper because our OverNite Disposable Diapers were still leaking and baby boy was waking up cold and wet :o(. We tried doubling up the disposables and that didn't work. Finally a Friend tipped me off to buying a diaper like this to cover over the disposable and it works! Early this AM baby boy took a big poo in his disposable which leaked over onto the Fuzzy Bunz and I was extremely impressed how well and easily the Poo washed off the extremely super soft, fuzzy FuzzyBunz. Wow! Also, even with the double up baby boy  seems comfortable in this diaper. The adjustments are very good.",5,1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds",These fit just as well as a BG. The insert fits inside the lining well. Softer than the BG inserts.,5,1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","First off, let me say these are the cutest mainstream diapers.  Fuzzibunz has the best solid colors out there.  They are all very bright and vibrant.  I do love that.  These are the diapers you want to put on your baby if you want to ""show off"" cloth diapers.  Like I said, they're cute.  They are also the trimmest pockets I've yet to see.  They work really well also which is the main thing.  My son has never had a leak in these.The downside?  They're really quite small for OS diapers.  I honestly have a hard time believing they'll fit up to 35lbs.  The other con is the adjustable elastic is a pain.  I have a 2 year old and an almost 4 month old, both in diapers and I can't easily switch between the two with these diapers like I can with other OS, it would just take way too long.  So I just designated these for my youngest.  I have to admit though in general I'm not crazy about adjustable elastic instead of rise snaps.  I found it annoying in Charlie Banana diapers as well.  I do appreciate that they give you spare elastic and two inserts though.I have four of these and because of the size issue, I don't think I'll be investing in more because I fear he'll grow out of them too soon.  It's a shame because they really are great diapers.  Overall I think Fuzzibunz perfect size diapers are a better grab.  I have 8 Mediums that fit both my boys and I know at the very least they'll last through potty training for my toddler.",4,1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","This isn't my favorite diaper but it isn't my most hated.  If found that I really like diapers with double leg gussets and the fuzzibunz don't have that option.  Also, my son is 4 months old, 15 lbs. and we are on the last size.  So I don't see these lasting as long, even though they are a great size now.  They are not bulky like others.  It is very easy to use and clean,  I like that it is a PUL do if I accidentally throw it in the dryer it isn't ruined.",4,1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I had been using prefolds and covers for six months before getting this diaper.I was pleased with how soft it is, and the colors are very cute. For some reason I had to adjust it to a larger setting than recommended, which is weird because my baby is on the smaller side. But other than that I really liked the adjustability of it. The only other negative thing I can think of is the buttons for adjustment are exposed so they may leave marks on baby if the diaper is on too tight.It's held in leaks quite well-- the inserts seem very absorbent.",4,1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I was hesitant at first to switch to cloth diapers.  However, my son is almost 2 years old now and I wish we had started cloth diapering earlier!  The One Size fits him perfectly.  We have had zero problems with leaks or blow outs.  I was really nervous that they wouldn't fit him well, but so far, so good.  I haven't had to adjust the elastic yet, but it looks pretty simple.  My husband and I experimented with the right snap formation for the first few days, but now we have it down to a science!  They also wash up great.  There are no stains and no smell.  Also?  They are super cute!  I also think they're extremely easy to use, so I'd recommend them to any first time cloth diaper users.",5,1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","This was an obvious choice when transitioning to cloth diapers.  I bought one to try and subsequently ordered more.  Love the color selection, love having the extra insert and elastic, and love the snaps.  I like that I can make it looser around my little one's thighs (he is rather chunky) and a bit tighter around his waist.  Velcro does not have this benefit.  They are very soft and comfortable and wash well.  I have washed them every day and line dried with no visible wear.  I can't offer a recommendation on a smaller baby since I came to use these later, but they fit my 24 lb 9 month old great.  I have had a couple of issues with leaking since the outer material is not water resistant, but if you change them often or add inserts, it should not be a problem.  If you are looking for something with better leak protection, either add a cover (although this could make it a bit too bulky) or check outThirsties Pocket All-in-One Cloth Diaper - Raspberry, X-Small 6-12 lbs.  Although the for me, theFuzziBunz One Size Cloth Diaper, Butterdo have a better fit.",5,1
"FuzziBunz 3 Pack Microfiber Inserts, Small","These are the perfect size and thickness for the one size pocket diapers. I used these in the bum genius, fuzzibunz, oh katy and happy heinys.",5,1
"FuzziBunz 3 Pack Microfiber Inserts, Medium/Large","I bought a lot of our FB used and they had inserts of questionable origin. I doubt they were original FB and if they are, they've gotton much better. I decided to upgrade all of my inserts with the four ply (not three ply, which they also sell) inserts. What a great idea! When I finish with the diapers I'll sell them again and even with replacing the inserts, practically make money on diaper use! I love the sized FB.",5,1
"FuzziBunz 3 Pack Microfiber Inserts, Medium/Large",i got these inserts for my fuzzi bunz diapers and they are amazing! they are super absorbent and great for doubling up with the small insert for overnight!,5,1
"FuzziBunz Wonder Wipes, 10 Pack","These are high quality wipes. They are super soft on one side, and a little gripy on the other. Work great for diaper changes. Probably my favorite wipes, I find myself saving them for when I 'really' need them, and using other thinner ones more often as I feel these are so special and luxurious. Wash well, still look good after months of using. Could also easily be used as a wash cloth or for spit up and spills.",5,1
"FuzziBunz Fleece Changing Pad, Light It Up Blue","We loved these when we had our third child three years ago.  We were in need of a replacement for one and this is the ONLY place we could find one.  If there are any left and you like them as much as we do, buy more now.",5,1
"FuzziBunz Zippered Diaper Tote, White","Love this bag for changes on the go.  I always have it in my diaper bag. I like that it's zippered and doesn't have a drawstring, so it doesn't get caught up on things in the wash or in my diaper bag.  It has held up well and hasn't had any leaks or smell.  I would definitely get this again.",5,1
"FuzziBunz Zippered Diaper Tote, White","This is great for at day care. It makes transporting dirty and wet diapers home to wash super easy! I also have the large one for using at home, I love that you can just toss them through the wash with the diapers.",5,1
Summer Infant Extra Camera For Day and Night Baby Video Monitor,"The camera/picture itself is great.  Definitely a nice feature to be able to control the camera from the monitor screen--our daughter is a mover when she sleeps, so being able to move the camera I can ""find"" her in her crib without going in there.  The only negative I have to say about this so far is that the battery on the monitor does not seem to last as long as I would have hoped, but as long as you can keep it in the base for overnight or longer than a few hours of use, it's fine for a few hours.",4,1
Summer Infant Extra Camera For Day and Night Baby Video Monitor,I read some negative reviews about using a second camera for this video monitor but it's working great in my medium-size apartment. I bought the monitor 2 years ago and now the second camera. The monitor is a little big compared to a LCD but it's by far the best value for baby video monitors: a relative small price for a very useful product. I recommend.,5,1
Tiny Love Gymini Sunny Day Activity Gym,This is a great 'escape for moms as it occupies baby for hours! I added more toys to it that were inexpensive and play music on my I pad right next to the mat so baby is entertained for hours without needing my intervention except to check up every few minutes. This will also last for a while as baby can use it in tumm and on back. Really recommend this...,5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Giraffe Stacker,My son will play with the giraffe more than the rings. He likes to touch and eat his ears. He will turn the giraffe over and play the drums on the bottom! When he was 3-4 months he played w/the polka dot ring the most basically eating it. He plays with the green ring that rattles a lot now at 10 months. The purple one just squeaks but only by the fish and I have to squeeze it for him.,4,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Giraffe Stacker,"I love this toy, and although I love the ones I had when I was a baby, this one is just as cute and very durable. My son loves it!",5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo,"great product! my baby start interested in walking at 4 months, didn't want to be laid down or sit. His first dance on this jumperoo made everyone laughs including himself. We enjoy watching him bouncing like a ball. Since he is always too excited, we only allowed him for 5-10 minutes. The thing needs to be improved is the foot stand. For little infant, they are too short to stand by themselves. The grandma has to make a customized semi-firm stand for his little feet. They should add it for the need of little ones. Overall, 4.5/5!",5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo,"This is a very entertaining, high quality toy.  It is a bit large once assembled. It does come apart for storage, but while using, it is not practical to disassemble simply to stow. It is about 3'x3'x3' of space.  The music is very engaging and upbeat, but when turned on, it continues playing incessantly.  The colors are bright and fun. There are a variety of activities to explore and my baby will be able to learn and discover features at each age as she grows.  It will last a long time with her development.  She is quite big for her age, but at 4 months, on the lowest setting, her feet barely touch the floor. I am very pleased with this purchase overall and would recommend it for any child over 4 months.UPDATE: at 6 months she loves this toy. She is always discovering a new feature and will continue to grow into her tow for months.  She can easily bounce and is very engaged and entertained for a full 30 minutes. (longest she has even been in)",5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo,"Let me start off by saying the first of these I received (purchased) had a few manufacturing flaws.  One of the base pipes was not manufactured properly and no matter how many times we switched them around, would not go together.  The plastic molded seat has 4 wheels attached on the bottom so it can go around 360 degrees.  Ours had 1 wheel missing, making it impossible to even fit in, let alone twirl.  I had reviewed many jumperoos and wanted this one because of the soft blue overhead tube to attach toys to so I ordered another one immediately through Amazon and it came the very next day before I even had time to send the ""bad"" one back.  Thank you Amazon!  I am glad I did.  Being a grandma with a 4 month old grandson who just got to the point he is tired of always being placed on his playmat, bumbo chair, or carried around in grandmas arms, the first day he tried this jumperoo he is one happy little guy!  Like most other reviewers his feet do not touch the floor yet and I played around with different size pillows for the full effect of jumping, he loves all the toys, the music, and the fact that grandma doesn't have to hold him in the standing position, he can do it (to some extent) himself.  He wears himself out jumping and therefore naps better, too.  Grandma loves that).",5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo,"I purchase this jumperoo last month when my baby turned 4 months old. After searching and reading all the reviews for the best jumperoo I decided to purchase this product.Though my baby still cannot reach the floor ( i just put a cushion on the floor for her toes to reach) she absolutely love it. At first she's not that interested but when my baby learns that it sounds when she jumps, she enjoy it. I put her in the morning as soon as she gets up so that i can have my breakfast.Now, i can do my stuff in the kitchen while watching my baby on her jumperoo. I highly recommend it especially if you have a fussy baby like mine.",5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo,"pros: lightweight, easy to move, baby likes it, lets me work out for 30 minutes.cons: it could have more toys for the price, the swivel seat doesn't swivel easy enough for my baby to do it on her own.",4,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo,"Our 5 month old baby loves the jumparoo. It was relatively easy to put together. There are NOT as many toys as I was expecting but the baby likes them. One of the toys keeps falling of and is really difficult to spin. The seat is good- not to big or wide, so the baby sits comfertably in it. The construction is sturdy, and the baby loves jumping. We had a doorway jumper but this is much better. I am glad we got this jumparoo.",4,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo,I love this jumperoo but I'm thinking her legs get a little sore in it after about 20 minutes because she starts to fuss. She can stay in her Exersaucer longer than the jumperoo. There is also more to do on the exersaucer than on the jumperoo. But we still love it and won't be getting rid of it anytime soon! I will take a baby-free 20 minutes anytime!,4,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo,"my granddaughter, coralee, loves to jump up and down in her jumparoo for long periods of time.  it keeps her moving constantly.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Scatterbug","I searched for awhile to find a high chair that suited our needs - portable, easy to clean, & space economical.  The Fisher-Price Space Saver works for us very well.  It easily attaches/detaches to any chair via 2 straps and is very secure.  The cover & straps come off to be washed.  Although they aren't cheap, I've even found quality replacement covers online. The chair is very adjustable and since it is convertible to a booster seat, I foresee us using it for many years.  One comment about the tray - even though it is dishwasher safe, I have yet to find a dishwasher that it fits into very well, but maybe I've just had small dishwashers.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Scatterbug","This is it! You get a full-sized sitting area and tray (with two cupholders!) for your child on a chair that takes up half the space of a traditional highchair. Easy to clean surfaces and easy to transfer with simple buckled straps. """"Scatterbug"""" design suitable for boy or girl. Great seat recline option for younger babies as well.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Swing to High Chair, Mosaic","Love this chair! My 19 month old son has sat and swung in it since he was a tiny thing! He can't swing in it now, but he loves to pick out his own music on the chair when he eats.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Swing to High Chair, Mosaic","I took a while for my husband to assemble the swing, the instructions in the manual were not very clear.My daughter loves the swing, it has a bunch of different songs for her to be entertained with!I would suggest trying putting ur lil one in a swing before buying one, no all the babies love them.The advantage of this particular swing is that you will use it as a high chair even if ur baby is not intoswinging. Great product!",4,1
"Fisher-Price Swing to High Chair, Mosaic",We ordered this one after our old fisher price high chair developed cracks. Its been over 6 months now and its going strong ! Love the color and the print.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler",It's as advertised. It keeps baby safe and entertained for 20min or so. Could have more interactive toys attached on the wand.Nice to have the ability to change to a toddle chair later on.,4,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler",Good to my baby hi take hours in that because it is good to baby even for more than a year,5,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler",It's easy to set up. The quality is good and sturdy. My husband and I love the color and the softness of the fabric. Can't wait for our baby to born to enjoy this!,5,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler",We love this because of how it fits our little one from infant to 12 month old and the swing away arm has let us utilize different play toys and easily move them out of the way when he sleeps or gets in & out.  The various reclining positions are great and it's easy to stabilize it to not rock.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler",I bought this one as a gift and it's really handy thing for a newborn baby. Unless you live in a very small house this is a must have thing!,5,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler","Este es uno de lo mejores regalos que le hemos dado a nuestra hija, ella es feliz y lleva m&aacute;s de seis meses divirti&eacute;ndose con ella.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler","We originally purchased this to have a vibrating place to put our child down when he was fussy and I was tired of cradling him.  It has fit the bill, and now serves the second function of providing a place for him to sit more upright after feedings, helping with his reflux.  I wish the chair would automatically turn off after a while, since it does frequently get left on for a long time.  And I don't love the design of the toy bar, so often leave it off.  Still, it has been a worthwhile purchase.  Please note however that it does not serve the same function as a bouncer, despite the rocker feature, because the baby cannot really move it himself, at least in the first six months.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler","This chair give you numerous options in terms of positioning the baby: two settings with the feet (in or extended/ front and back); two with back legs, and two with the seat back. Swing toy arm is also great, so that you don't have to remove it to sit or pick up the baby. Neither of our twins seems to care that much for vibration, but it's a nice option. My babies can happily sit in it for many hours.  We also use it sometimes for sleeping (raised back helps with reflux) and eating. My only (very minor) pet peeve is the print on the back. There are big insect eyes high on the seat back, which look funny when taking pictures of the baby.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler","My baby girl love this rocket,..she looks very happy , and takes nice naps. .it's secure , safe, strong and pretty good. ..",5,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler","This thing is great!!! So originally we had a different fisher price bouncer (safari theme) that acutally broke while our infant was on it, we then got another rocker from our cousin which was fantastic, that is until our child was rocking so hard on it she flipped right over.  That was the end of that! I went on a search to find a rocker that could be mutli use as well as something that was stationary if need be.  I figured she will eventually grow out of this phase, but still want a chair/rocker, and this thing is fantastic, sometimes she falls asleep in it in the reclining position, sometimes shes fed in it in the upright position..when she gets a bit older, she can use it too, best part is, its solid, not flimsy or shakey. Best bouncer out there, and i've never seen it in stores, but order on amazon it will arrive super fast!",5,1
"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler","I was looking for something to keep in the living room to put the baby in after nursing, and this is it! I love that it adjusts from a basinet up to rocking chair. The baby falls right asleep with the vibrating option. It's great the toy bar detaches so I can rock it with my foot without rocking the toys. I gave it 4 stars because the toys aren't that great, there is no sounds or music option and the sun shade is pretty short. Overall I love it. Baby has been using it since 4 weeks old.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","I care for my 5 month old granddaughter during the work week.  I needed a high chair that did not take up a lot of space (like a stand alone chair) and one that I can easily remove from a dining room chair when necessary.  This high chair works perfect!  Baby is still quite young so I haven't used the tray or booster part yet, but the chair itself, with cover, restraints, and position options works very well.  I have used the high chair to place Baby next to me when I'm using the computer.  She is happy chewing on toys while watching me work.  If she falls asleep for a short nap, I recline the seat for her.  Having Baby a little higher up from the floor sometimes (versus boppy pillow, bouncy seat, or jumparoo) gives her a little different view of her surroundings.  The mocha cover with butterflies is a fabulous color scheme.  I am a big butterfly fan and have butterflies on kitchen walls for accents.  I highly recommend this space saver high chair.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","The Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chairs are by far my favorite high chairs. These little chairs are so awesome. We've owned one for a little over six years now when our granddaughter was born. We didn't want a traditional chair that took up a lot of floor space which we don't have much to spare. So this was the chair we found. It was quite expensive back then but was worth it because we thought we were making an investment. What an investment we made! This chair has not only been through our granddaughter, but our friends children, neighbors grandchildren when they visit, and now our grandson. It still looks almost like new. Keeping it clean is the secret to that. And NOT letting food sit on it and dry into the straps.The chair itself fits on any chair and straps onto it from the bottom of the high chair tightly. Also from behind. It can also fit on a bar stool turned upside down, between the bottom legs.The tray can be removed easily while your holding your baby with one hand by a front lever or while they are sitting in it by two levers on either side of the tray. Especially when it's filled with food and baby goo! And you want to wash him /her up with out them putting their hands back into the dirty tray. It's quite easy to remove it and put it aside while you clean the baby up and the rest of the chair.The pad and straps. It's made of soft vinyl unless otherwise noted. Some come with a cloth chair cover. But for the life of me I don't understand why. Knowing how much food they can drop down into the seat. But I guess that's for those who love doing laundry all the time. The seat can be easily wiped down. Occasionally I use white vinegar to sanitize the seat, straps, and tray. The seat cover does come apart. It's not easy and does take time to do it. But it can be done. there are clips under the arms of the chair and under the front of the seat. Just pull them down. Undo the straps and take the clips off the straps. Now lift the seat cover off the seat. And push the straps through the holes in the back of the seat. This is the tough part. It takes some pushing and pulling at the same time but they do come off. Once they are off, I scrubb them with oxiclean and a few drops of liquid laundry detergent and let them sit. If they have gotten stained, I soak them with peroxide and let them sit for 10 -15 min. Then rinse with warm water, then wash as usual. If they are really bad, use the white vinegar as a soak. when you let them dry, place them out in the sunshine to dry. They don't smell like your salad, I promise and they come up very white. Just don't use fabric softener on them.  They will hold their stiffness, like new straps. The seat use the oxi clean to wipe the surface of the seat, and rinse with vinegar water.Now the tray does fit in the dishwasher. OK folks.. IT TAKES UP THE WHOLE BOTTOM SHELF! I don't wash it in there that often. Only when it's been a while or if he's been really messy OR he's sick. Then it goes into the dishwasher for sanitary reasons, Otherwise I have a deep sink and it gets washed in there for general purposes with antibacterial Dawn.The new Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chairs now grow with your children. They can go from new born to toddler and you don't need a new chair. Also these beauties can be passed from child to child. I love them so much, they are my favorite baby shower gift to give! I aslo suggest that if you are a grandparent that your grandchild/grandchildren visit often, or you have little ones that visit often, this is a chair that should be part of your baby gear. It doesn't take much room up. For parents, it travels well. And for caregivers, it's fabulous!If you need an idea as an Angel Tree gift for church for a baby gift.. This is the best $35.-$55. gift to buy for a new born or infant. There are many styles to choose from. As for us we tend to go neutral unless the girls ask for a specific pattern. The Scatterbug pattern is cute.All in all.. we love this chair.",5,1

"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","This high chair is awesome! We bought this specific one because it doesn't take up extra floor space, it has the dishwasher safe tray and the washable cover. When we received the high chair, it was very easy to assemble and put into my dining chair. The two reasons that I deducted one star was that it did not come with the tray inserts that some of the other models of this same chair come with and that the strap that goes under the bottom of the dining chair, the buckle is facing upward towards the bottom of the chair seat. It makes it a little awkward to tighten the high chair down.",4,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink",Bought this for my children to use for my grandson.  Holds securely to chair and holds him in safely.  Would recommend.,5,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink",bought this for my home when my grandaughter visits - easy to use and clean and is small and stores away nicely.  Would recommend if you have limited space or are only using when the baby visits :),4,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","I bought this chair for when my grandchildren come to visit.  I like that I can also take it with me to restaurants and other people's houses with no problems.  It grows with the child, so started with a one year old.  Now that she's two, I took the liner out and it works just fine.  I agree with other reviews about the color of the straps.  A darker color wouldn't stain so much.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink",I bought this for my sisters baby and it is so cute.  She is in the military and travels a lot so this seat is perfect for her to bring with her.,5,1

"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink",I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and it is the best high chair ever it fits on any chair and i love the fact that it is able to recline the back of the seat for feeding since this is his first time eating solids.would recommend to any parent or grandparent,5,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","Love this seat!!! This is for my 2nd son, I had regular high chair for my 1st son and it was taking up too much space. So, this time acound I decided to order this space saver, baby is very confortable in it and tray is easy to attach and remove. Baby is right on the level with all of us at dining table. This way we can all take meals as a family.",5,1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","I received this high chair as a gift when our second daughter was born...we needed a second one because our first daughter was/is only 17 months and therefore still using hers.  We LOVE our first daughter's chair, however this one seems to be somewhat more cheaply made and just not as well made as the version from 2 years ago.  The recline is also significantly different - only the top part of the chair reclines, where as the entire chair reclined on the older version, which made for a much more comfortable recline for the baby.  In general, it's still a really great seat and I have no major complaints.  I just don't like the ""improvements"" that they've made in the past couple of years!",4,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"I used a bouncer made by a different brand with my first child, but it was damaged in storage. I found this one and the price was very affordable and I loved the mocha butterfly pattern. Now, I have been using it for almost a month, since I brought my daughter home from the hospital and we both love it. It is very lightweight and easy to carry from room to room. If my daughter is fussy, I can usually calm her down by putting her in the bouncer, bouncing it, and singing to her. The battery life seems to be long as I have left the vibration feature on overnight a few times and its still going strong. I do wish the vibration feature had an automatic turn off feature, but for the price, I can't complain.",5,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"My daughter loves this chair, she cries when the vibrations aren't turned on.  Definetly worth getting for anyone with a new baby girl and it looks cute too.  Easy to put together.  Even used it at Grandma and Grandpa's house, took it apart, and put it back together at home.",5,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"This bouncer is perfect for babies and mommies alike! The toys are at the level of even a very young baby and it bounces easily so when baby moves it bounces a bit--not to mention you can easily bounce it with a foot from the couch to help soothe a little one! Plus, love that the toy bar removes so easily since I also use that often times to feed my little man in--it sits at a good angle so that the feeding time is easier when you start baby foods. Only minor thing is that the 'headrest' flap is upside down on ours--not sure if that's how they all are? It doesn't really matter it just makes it look silly when its unoccupied and the monkey is just hanging out upside down!",5,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"I am so glad I got this for my baby!! When he was 3 months old, he kicked around in it & fell asleep in it almost all the time. Now that he's almost 5 months old, and rolling over a lot it's a nice, safe place to buckle him up whenever I have to leave the room for a few minutes. He still loves it :)",5,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,Baby loves it! She was preemie and at 4 1/2 lbs fits comfortably wrapped in blanket in this bouncer. Would buy again,4,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"Adorable colors! My 3 week old loves this- it's very sturdy yet comfy and the vibration setting is low, unlike some seats that go crazy with vibration. The toys on the bar are bright and colorful and my daughter loves to look at and try to touch them. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a simple yet reliable baby seat. Great price too!",5,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"My daughter loves this very much. It never gives a problem, good quality and pretty design. Thank you very much",5,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"If you are a new parent, you really need to get one of these!  My baby sits in it while I'm doing stuff in the kitchen, looking at the computer, or showering in the bathroom.  Easy to move from room to room to give baby a change of scene and to hold him while you are doing something that requires both hands.  The frog and turtle print is cheerful and coordinates with our decor.  Our baby is not that into the vibrating motion, and doesn't like the toy bar at all because it blocks his view of what's going on.  The toys on the toy bar aren't that great.  The musical frog toy ran out of batteries after being played fewer than 10 times, and the turtle rattles aren't very easy for  a baby to grasp.  I wish the toys were detachable so I could hang other, more interesting stuff on the toy bar.",4,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"the chair is very comfy for my 4 month old, the fabric is nice and not slippery.  The only downside is that the toys are very hard, I had to remove the bar so her fingers would't keep hitting them. Also my baby weights 13 pounds and her weight causes the chair to dip back a little so she's not as upright as pictured, but she doesnt seem to mind.",4,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"excellent seat, beautiful, nice design, it serves for baby to be entertained while doing household chores, the only thing wrong is that when the baby grows, loses",5,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"This chair has been a lifesaver for me so I can take a daily shower. I place it next to shower, turn vibrate feature on, leave curtain half open, and I can cleanse myself and keep an eye on baby. The vibrate feature is great and we've not replaced batteries yet even though I've had this for 2 months now and constantly leave it on when we go out. Only thing I wish is that the music played constantly or was activated by babies movement. It's annoying having to constantly pull the ring to sound the music.***UPDATE***Now my daughter is 5 months and can pull the toy on her own, so eventually...the fact you have to pull the ring to activate the music is not so annoying. Now it's annoying when she is constantly pulling it! :)***",4,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,This bouncer was a good purchase. Now our 7 week old can sit up & watch us instead of being held all the time. It gives us a chance to do what we need to do & her the chance to sit us w/o our assistance & observe her surroundings. I'm oleased.,4,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,Easy to carry room to room. She loves the vibration. The toys keep her eyes busy and it's easy to clean.,4,1
Fisher-Price Comfy Time Bouncer,"I did alot of research looking for the perfect bouncer for my 2 and half month old son. I chose this one based on the very good reviews. It is sooo cute and good quality material. Material has good cushion, design and colors are super cute and toys are entertaining and the vibrating thing works perfect, not too much nor too little. I like the cushion bar because I can add other toys, seating is perfect. You will not be disappointed.",5,1

"Carters Super Soft Printed Changing Pad Cover, Blue",So soft and plush with very subtle polka dots. It is a very light blue and the picture is the perfect representation of the color. I love it!,5,1
"Carters Super Soft Printed Changing Pad Cover, Blue","I have two of these that I switch between for my now 21 month old. We have been using this since the day he came home. I have a sage green one and the brown one. I just purchased the blue dot one for my newest arrival in a couple of months. They have held their shape and have not stained at all, even with breast fed poop.  We did use the boppy covers that go in the middle for the first couple of months to help with unexpected pees while changing the diaper and extra runny poops to help reduce the amount of times it needed to be washed and changed since we only bought two.  I haven't used those in probably 18 months though and the changing covers still look new. I highly recommend these as they are soft and durable.  Well worth the money, no matter where you get them.",5,1
"Carters Super Soft Printed Changing Pad Cover, Blue",This product was delivered promptly and was exactly the same as shown in the advertisement.  It will be perfect for my first grandchilds room.,5,1
"BreathableBaby Breathable Bumper for Portable and Cradle Cribs, White","I wanted something that would prevent little legs from getting stuck between railings as well as keep extra pacifiers in the crib for the munchkin to find at night.The bumper is light, non-smelly, and most importantly breathable. The mesh allows the air in but keeps little arms and legs inside.I attached it to my DaVinci minirocking crib, wrapping the bumper on the INSIDE of the crib. It fit just fine, in fact, looks like there is enough fabric to try and wrap it outside the crib too. I slid it low, almost to the bottom of the mattress - so far no sagging of the fabric anywhere around the crib.Have not washed it yet, will report back about the bumpers integrity after few washes.",5,1
"BreathableBaby Breathable Bumper for Portable and Cradle Cribs, White","I love this bumper! I purchased this for our Alma mini crib. My son liked to thrust his limbs through the bars, then protest loudly when he couldn't extract them. It completely solved the problem.",5,1
"BreathableBaby Breathable Bumper for Portable and Cradle Cribs, White","Recommended to me for a grandbaby's crib for a visit. It is very breathable, but I can't see how it can be called a bumper with no padding.",4,1
"BreathableBaby Breathable Bumper for Portable and Cradle Cribs, White","After reading so many warnings and horror stories about bumpers, I took down my cute matching crib bumper set. I was too afraid that my baby would get stuck and suffocate with the plush bumper, but then was it was off, I was afraid my baby would hit her head and get hurt. I left the crib bumper-less for a a few days, but then saw her foot constantly getting stuck through the crib slats.I originally registered for this breathable bumper, but did not have a mini crib at the time. I purchased this and love it.The pink color is gorgeous against a white crib and it does the job. It's completely breathable even if you push your face right up against it (trust me, I tried). This makes me feel good knowing that my baby can still breathe. It also offers some soft cushioning against the wood, so that makes me feel better too. I wish that is didn't sag down as much and it should probably have more ties, but I am happy with this purchase and also purchased the full crib size version too.",5,1
"BreathableBaby Breathable Bumper for Portable and Cradle Cribs, White",This cradle bumper is just as the description says.  It is soft and thick but still breathable.  I love the shiny silk that lines the top and bottom and the fact that it has Velcro and not ties all over it.,5,1
"BreathableBaby Breathable Bumper for Portable and Cradle Cribs, White",These breathable bumpers are awesome! I just bought mine and my daughter is 8months old. Should have bought it a long time ago!!  Love 'em!,5,1

"Athena Daphne Convertible Crib and Changer, Cherry","I have to build two of these, twin boys on the way. The whole box that's shipped to you is 130+ lbs. Very heavy! When I opened the box and saw 15+ individual boxes inside I thought &#34;holy crap!&#34;. Once I opened the directions and started working I discovered it was the easiest assembly I have ever tried on any product. Building a 2-drawer ClosetMaid unit was 10x harder.The frame/drawers are extremely sturdy and the wood is quality with no prefab smell you'll sometimes get. I would recommend this bed to anyone who asks and I am actually looking forward to building the next one. This is probably the first assembly I've done without uttering some kind of swear word.amazing price and great product, who would have thought for ~$250",5,1
"Athena Daphne Convertible Crib and Changer, Cherry","I wasn't sure about ordering a crib for my baby on the way online without seeing it in person first, but I am so glad I took the risk. I love this crib. Its cute and has ample storage and looks exactly as pictured. The changing table is smaller like other reviews have stated but is still really nice. My only complaint might be that it has only one mattress position which is really low and can't be raised and I'm 5'5 and can't reach all the way in without a step stool or something. That part doesn't bother me much for now though because my son will be sleeping in my bed for the first few months in a cosleeper, so by the time I actually have him sleep in the crib it should be easier to get him in and out. The other little problem was with it getting a scratch/ding in it from shipping it but it doesn't affect the safety or anything else really, its just cosmetic...Overall its a great crib for the price and great if you have to have it in your room or just don't have the space for all the nursery furniture but still want it all!",5,1

Clay Keepsake &amp; Photo Desktop Frame - Red Mahogany,"I had bought a similar product 5 years ago for my older daughter, but this one is of better quality and easier to use. The hand/footprint material is not plaster but clay, so we got a better impression much more easily. The frame itself is also of better quality. Very happy with it!",5,1

E-lock Switch Guard Ivory,"I love this product. It was extremely easy to install, easy for me to use, didn't damage the light switch. Most importantly, it completely ended the light switch battle I was having with my 2 year old. My daughter was constantly getting out of bed and tunring on the lights. If she couldn't reach the switch she would use her toys to build a ramp so she could get at it. When I took the offending toys out of the room she emptied her dresser drawers and got to the switch using a pile of laundry. I was at my wits end and sick of the battle. Some mornings I would walk in at 5 am and she would be asleep with the lights on. However, since installing this switch bedtime is no longer a battle. It took two days for her to realize she can't get past this switch and now she goes to bed and stays there. Hooray!",5,1
Bento Decoration - Food Picks (Animal) 15pcs,"Nice little picks for your kid's food. Some are a little tall to fit into a sealed lunch box, especially my bento box, but still, they made my son's food enticing which encouraged him to eat each bite. There are quite a few of these in the package so you can definitely use them for a full meal or several items in the lunch box.I love 'em!They are easy to wash as well and cheap enough that if your child loses a few you wont be distraught. Buy a couple packs. You'll be so happy!",5,1
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set, ABC",Great quality. Very soft and washes well.  I highly recomend this.  The colors are perfect for our sons nursery.  We love the ABC Dr.Seuss motif since it will grow well with our son from infant to toddler.,5,1
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set, ABC","My sister added these to her Amazon baby registry, and since I'm a wonderful sister (and now aunt), I purchased them for her for my nephew's Dr. Seuss themed room.  I think they are a great, colorful 'neutral' - they would work well for a boy's or girl's room.These bedding pieces cover all of the basics:  they're adorable, they fit well in the crib, they are quality construction, the colors haven't faded or run, they are easy to clean, etc.  They're fantastic.But the real reason I finally felt like coming back to review them, a little more than a year and a half later, and give them five stars is because this was my sister's Facebook post earlier this week:  &#34;Not sure what to be more excited about...Jack-Jack sleeping in until 9:45 in his own bed or how I heard that he was finally up when he started saying the different letters that are all over his sheet!&#34;My 1 1/2 year old nephew actually woke up and entertained himself by pointing out the letters on his sheets and saying them.  I'm a proud aunt!So, you really can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss ABC sheets.",5,1
"Trend Lab Dr Seuss Diaper Stacker, ABC","I love that this matches my bedding perfectly. BUT, I use cloth diapers and the flimsy cardboard in the top section bent under the weight of only 12 diapers.

SoftSpot by Wozzy Play Mat,"We have been using the play mat since my son first began sitting up unassisted.  If he falls over on this, he never cries because it's just enough padding to prevent the ""owie"" that he would get on the carpet.  I can imagine that we will use this for years to come.",5,1

Bean B Clean Baby Scalp Massaging Brush for Cradle Cap,"This product has been great for keeping up with the cradle cap. Gentle enough to use every day, we haven't had any issues since we started using it",5,1
Bean B Clean Baby Scalp Massaging Brush for Cradle Cap,"My husband and i have been using this on our son since he was about 1 week old and we saw that my sister in laws son had HORRIBLE cradle cap (It freaked us out!)We use it with his Baby Magic and it suds up in his hair very easy, the bristle are VERY soft and he LOVES when I was his hair.. It makes bath time fun for him and us! NO sign of cradle cap yet!",5,1
Bean B Clean Baby Scalp Massaging Brush for Cradle Cap,It worked for my sons cradle cap. But I have a hard time cleaning it.,4,1
Bean B Clean Baby Scalp Massaging Brush for Cradle Cap,"I've had two different versions of this brand's brush.  I've used them over the last four years.  I don't actually use them for cradle cap- I just use them for every day.  Both my sons are wigglers when it comes to me shampooing their hair, so using this brush helps me make sure that I'm making every swipe count.  It just seems like their rough, thick hair gets clearner down to the scalp.  As my older son gets bigger, he's been using this on himself and I think it's easier than just teaching him to use his fingers for now.  I've had three of these over the four years- they last.  Just make sure that you pop out the brush part every once in awhile for cleaning and that you put it brush-side down to dry after use.  The brush part might be hard to clean with longer hair, but for short hair this works great!",5,1
"Pearhead Giraffe Growth Chart, Blue",I love the cute design and the fact that my daughter can leave her mark on her own growth chart!  I would recommend getting your child's actual measurement and then marking it on the growth chart rather than backing them up to it and drawing a line as is traditionally done.  This eliminates any errors from chart misplacement or wiggling.,5,1
Handmade Welcome Baby Ornament by Wendell August Forge,"I bought this as a present to my cousin as they got a baby girl on 27th of December-she was supposed to arrive on 15th:-).

BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,"We started sitting our daughter on her potty to get her used to the idea as early as 6 months. She loves her potty. It's comfortable, fits her well and has plenty of room for growth. The removable insert is designed well and does not pinch her legs when she sits or gets up, which another potty did! Very happy with this one and would recommend to anyone. Just make sure to hold your baby when they're on the potty in the beginning so they don't fall off and hurt themselves or have a bad experience. Happy potty training.",5,1
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,I got two of these potties for my twins. It is easy to clean by taking out the insert and they are portable. We've brought it out to the back yard for easy access. Now we also have one in the back of the car for potty emergencies.,5,1
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,"I wish we would have had this potty when we were training our 1 yr old.  We finally got it because we had bought Safety 1st stool/potty second hand--thank God because it would have been a waste of money as it is NOT built for boys & is the biggest pain to clean every time, not to mention it is still too high for our almost 2yr old (33 inches) to set himself down on.  The Baby Bjorn Smart Potty on the other hand is short enough for him to set himself on all by himself which has been a big motivator for him.  It is easy to clean & small enough for our tiny 5x5 bathroom, although he likes to put it in the linen closet each time anyway.  We also have the Baby Bjorn Potty Ring that has also been great!  Between these two potties & ""Daddy style"" (stand him up on edge of potty making him lean over to grab the lid), we are able to give him choices about how he will go potty which has been a good motivator.",5,1
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,"Its very small, a good shape for the squat position, has abig splash guard, and it pours easily. I recommend it.",5,1
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,"When my daughter was sitting up on her own, around six months old, we bought this potty. Every time I use the toilet, I take off her diaper and sit her on this potty. Without any intervention, crazy queue words, she just went poop, the first time. I sit her on it every time I need to go and most of the time she pees or poops. She is not 8 months, and I probably count many times I have cleaned a poopy diaper. The potty is good and small, but it is still a little large. She has fallen off of it twice, though I was there to catch her, it was a little scary. I would recommend this potty.",5,1
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,"This is a great little potty seat.  Plain and white with a simple design (it doesn't get them used to going potty on a throne) it's easy to keep clean and has an easily removable vessel to make emptying it simple.  I would definitely recommend it.  The only thing I would advise is if you're potty trainee is older, this seat is fairly small.",5,1
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,We got this small one when traveling to visit relatives and the kept it for the upstairs bathroom when we returned. It does the job for our son as well as the taller backed one it seems though I think he likes to sit on the other a bit longer which can be good if things are taking a little while. We got it a month or two before our son turned 2 and he's excited to show us that he pooped and get a big applause. Emptying a potty is a bit nasty I've realized though but he doesn't seem to do as well dangling from a big toilet.,5,1
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,"This little potty is perfect for small spaces. It doesn't take up much room at all. It's just the right size. Very easy to clean. Stable and won't tip over. I would recommend this for anyone. It might be a little short if your child is very tall, but otherwise perfect.",5,1
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,"I bought this potty for my 9 m.o. daughter. I liked that it wasn't too bulky and not to high since it would allow my baby to properly squat, which is the most natural position for babies to go ..However, my baby didn't like that potty. I'm not sure what was the reason.., whether it wasn't the right color..or the right design, she just wouldn't let me to sit her on it.",4,1

Circo&reg; Toddler Love n Nature Bedding Set,"Our three year old daughter needed a toddler sheet set. We didn't want to spend a lot. We wanted something soft, durable, and well made. We were very happy to find the set was all of these things. VERY soft, adorable theme (c'mon, there are hedgehogs, toadstools and owls!) I just feel sad she'll only be using the set for a year or two before transitioning to a full size bed....",4,1
Circo&reg; Toddler Sports Bedding Set,"I have a big sports fan and he loves this bedding! I still have him in his crib, so the comforter is a little big, but I fold it in half and it works fine. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend!",5,1

"Trend Lab Dr Seuss ABC Toddler Bedding Set, 4 Piece","It was interesting because I have never heard of hugger sheets, but the flat sheet and blanket have fitted sheet type elastic at the base to keep it on the mattress.  It works well for the toddler/crib size mattress.  Unfortunately because there are no cat in the hat sheets sold on the internet in twin size I was hoping to use these for the twin bed.  They probably won't look quite right and I will need to release the elastic.  Otherwise this product is great.  The sheets could be softer but the novelty items are never as soft as you want them to be.",4,1
"Trend Lab Dr Seuss ABC Toddler Bedding Set, 4 Piece","I bought this for my two year olds bedroom. I wanted something that could grow with him and not have to be replaced every year as he grew in and out of favorite characters.This set is perfect!! The colors are rich and vibrant and the comforter is really soft. The middle panel does pull in a bit when you wash it - this is NOT because of fabric shrinkage but because of the embrodiery. Embrodiery thread tends to shrink a it when it gets wet but if you tug gently at all four sides of the panel and then hang the comforter up to dry you will get rid of the bunching. Overall I'm THRILLED with our purchase, I will try to post a photo with the review later.",5,1
12 Pack FuzziBunz Perfect Size SMALL Cloth Diapers GENDER NEUTRAL colors,"Love our fuzzibunz & so does our daughter. They are so soft & super absorbent - sometimes we're not even sure if the diaper is wet. Occasionally we get leaks, however, she's only 4 weeks old and her legs are still a bit on the thin side. We expect this problem to go away once she's a bit bigger.",5,1

Nike Jordan Classic '23' Red and Black Infants or Baby Bodysuit Cap/ Hat Booties+ Free 3.5mm Anti Dust Plug- Iviva,"I am surprised by the few negative reviews about the quality and construction.  We found this item to be of good quality and easy to assemble properly. I even drag it from room to room and nothing has come loose. This toy has been a lifesaver.  Our daughter was diagnosed with reflux at 4 months and had to be kept upright after meals.  We brought out the jumparoo before we had planned on introducing it and she could sit happily in it after meals. She was too little to touch the ground even on the lowest setting, but enjoyed spinning the ball which was all she could reach.  She loved that the music came on when we would bounce her gently.  It also allowed my husband and I to have our dinner together while she was nearby, safe and happy. Now she is 8 months and can enjoy all of the activities.  The animals on the bar above help little ones stretch their arms and focus on objects at a distance.  On the second setting, they can reach the suspended animals.  They are not frustrating or worthless.  I love that it grows with the baby. Ours is on the second setting at 20 lbs, and the seat can be raised one more time which means she will likely be bored by it before she out grows it - which is good.  There are many things for baby to do and try without being overloaded.",5,1
Maxi Cosi Priori Convertible Car Seat,"Just received this 2 days ago. First, I suspected it may have an older manufacture date based on the price being about $50 lower than the other MaxiCosi Priori's on Amazon. I was right. The manufacture date was Sept. 2008. Not a HUGE problem, since the expiration date on the seat is 2015, so I still have 5 years to use it. Both of my kids will have outgrown it by then, and even if we have a third child, I would probably want a newer seat by then since safety standards are always changing.I chose this seat because my Jeep Grand Cherokee has fixed headrests in the back and so most other car seats sat too tall to fit properly on either side, and I needed to move the car seat from the middle position to make room for the infant carrier for my new baby. This seat fits very nicely. Tha material looks great and I will say, the seat bottom is much more cushiony than the Britax Marathon we had been using. The colors are very nice too, and I chose them because we live in the south, so I wanted light colors to help reflect some summer heat.My son loves this seat so far. He says it's comfortable and he really likes that he has a cup holder. He's just over 2, but tall - 37 or 38 inches. I had to adjust the harness to the highest height, so I""m not sure how long this seat will really last, but it says it goes up to 43 inches in height, so hopefully a while longer until we get a different vehicle. But then I realized that I was just about to move the harness to the highest position in the Britax Marathon as well, so that's really no big deal.The only real reason I gave this seat 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had such a hard time tightening it in the car. The lower latches only tighten on one side, meaning that you hook both sides, then pull on the one side to tighten both latches. I couldn't pull hard enough even when kneeling completely in the seat to keep it from moving more than 1 inch side to side. And the upper latch was also difficult for me to tighten. I needed my husband to sit in the seat and pull while I pushed the seat back tight into the car seat in order to get a fit I was happy with. Now the seat fits securely, with little to no give. However, I will definitely not be taking this seat out any time soon. It was WAY too hard to get in tight. I never had any trouble getting my previous car seat or the infant carrier in securely by myself.Overall, I like this seat very much. The 4 position recline is terrific and super easy to use, the material seems good quality, the size is just right, and my son loves riding in it. The installation could be better if the lower latches tightened independently, but you can always take the seat to a police or fire station to have them check the installation and fit, so it's not anything to worry about.",4,1

"Sassy Rattlin Rings, Blue/Black","We purchased these because of all the great reviews of the product and we were not disappointed.  They feel substantial, make great noise (not too loud, not too soft) and the rings are a nice addition, because they move around and give our daughter something to make a little noise with.  We are very happy with our purchase and definitely recommend these.  Oh, and definitely go with the two pack versus the individual.  It is always nice to have an extra of great toys!",5,1
"Sassy Rattlin Rings, Blue/Black","I bought this for my son when he was about a month old and he did not have much interest in this at all until he was almost 3 months. Now that he's 7 months old, this is his must have toy to be around. He plays with it on the change table, his swing, in the car seat, in the stroller and even on his floor mat. I don't know what it is, but he loves to chew on it and just swing it around crazily. The toy is very well made and the colors are nice. It's easy to clean, just use soapy water, rinse, air dry and it's ready for him the next day.",5,1
"Sassy Rattlin Rings, Blue/Black","my baby liked the strong contrast of the colors, but the rattle could be a little louder (they are just the little beads you see in the clear part). also the smaller rings are a little too small for baby to hold.",4,1

"Sassy Rattlin Rings, Blue/Black",My 4 month old LOVES this rattle. It has really helped with hand-eye-mouth coordination. Size is good for baby to grip with one hand and place in mouth to chew.,5,1

"BUGGYGEAR  Retractable Stroller Lock, Monkey",It's easy to use and you can set your own code. There's a lot of places that don't allow strollers and I just feel safer leaving our stroller behind locked securely to something.,5,1
"Britax Adapter Strap Kit, Black",We are using this on our Baby Trend side-by-side double jogging stroller to secure our Chicco Key Fit car seat in the stroller.  It works wonderfully!  Thank you Britax!,5,1
"Britax Adapter Strap Kit, Black","I wanted a B-Nimble stroller for my Chaperone, but didn't want to pay the price, so I got a stroller for half the price that is compatible with infant seats. But alas Britax seats don't click on like others.  This strap attached easily so that I could make sure the seat was secure if the stroller tipped or what not. This product would work for any brand car seat!",5,1
"Britax Adapter Strap Kit, Black","I got this for a Joovy Caboose Ultralight Sit and Stand because I bought it used and it was missing the car seat strap. I could have gotten one from Joovy for fairly cheap, but I liked that this is black and I'm picky about stuff like that. I've even used this on a maclaren umbrella stroller with the car seat sitting on the seat of the stroller (not recommended but I did it in a pinch) and it worked well. Pretty versatile Sadly I lost one side of the strap, but I am thinking of ordering another because it worked so well and was a good price.",5,1
"Hotslings Adjustable Pouch Baby Carrier, La Vie Rose",I love this carrier and had to have it before my baby was born. It is stylish and works great but my baby did not dig it. I was so hyped to get it but bummed that I never really used it. Maybe it will work with the next baby =),5,1
Happiest Baby on the Block DVD,"I was absolutely appalled to read negative reviews for this DVD.  The ""5 Ss"" techniques taught in this DVD do work!  It is really quite something to witness and just amazing when you actually put them into practice.  I could not even begin to imagine not having these techniques in my parenting tool kit when my first child arrived.  The reduced stress and added sleep you gain from putting these simple skills to work is worth the price of the DVD a hundred times over.  My wife and I have recommended this DVD to everyone we know that is expecting and it has become the gift we are sure to give when invited to a baby shower.  If you are expecting a new little one, get this DVD!  It may seem a little corny and hard to believe when you watch it, but if you actually do what Dr. Karp tells you to do, it'll work and there is no way you will ever regret making this purchase.You should check out the website for yourself too by the way:  [...]",5,1
"Green to Grow Twin Pack Regular Neck Glass Baby Bottles, 4 Ounce",I love glass baby bottles! They are wonderful and durable.. a little to heavy for baby to hold but amazing!,5,1
Stokke Xplory Cup Holder,"I thought it was a little much to buy this fancy cup holder after spending so much on the Stokke Stroller, but it has been a necessity for our walks since the stroller is so streamlined, there really isn't any other place to put things right in front of you.  I use it for my phone a lot more than I use it for drinks, because I always like to have my phone handy in case of an emergency with the baby.",5,1
Stokke Xplory Cup Holder,"Stokke just knows how to construct & engineer quality.  This is a high end stroller, and is such quality that it is 5 years old and looks brand new.  The cup holder is a key accessory.  Highly recommended!",5,1
"Learning Curve Super Why Insulated Sippy Cup, 2 Pack","I have a 3 year old and an 18 month old and I can honestly say these are the very best cups. Easy, lightweight. All cups leak a little bit so you are never going to find the leakless cup. The key to these cups is that upon the first use, you have to poke throught the little valve on the lid a bit to get it open. after that- even the smaller kiido will love these cups. Mine do! The hubby and I love them because when you have a kid screaming for milk at 6am- on eless step of screwing around with the valve will really make your life easier ;)",5,1
PlayTray for the Stokke Tripp Trapp  - Transparent,"Like many, I bought the Tripp Trapp chair because I wanted my child to sit at the table with us.  And for the first child, we did just that.For the second child, I also wanted him to be able to sit in his chair and play with his toys in a tray while I cooked in the kitchen.  And I wanted the food mess to stay contained.  AND I wanted to keep using the Tripp Trapp chair.The play tray has allowed us to do all of these things.  We have an older style wooden baby guard, and the tray fits over/around this.  That means I can easily remove the tray and sit the baby directly at the table without unscrewing and disassembling the chair. AWESOME.Yes, it's expensive.  I thought long and hard about buying it.  I'm not disappointed.  In fact, I wish I'd bought it for the first child.  The plastic is beautiful and solid (as plastic goes).  And this product really, truly fixes the disadvantages of the Tripp Trapp.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.",5,1
PlayTray for the Stokke Tripp Trapp  - Transparent,"The Tripp Trapp PlayTray is excellent. It does what is claims to do. It is easy to clean, put on/off, and looks good. It also brings the food closer to our baby so she can easily reach it and lets her eat at a comfortable height. Additionally, it provides support so that we didn't need to purchase the Stokke baby set.",5,1
PlayTray for the Stokke Tripp Trapp  - Transparent,"I love this trey.  It cleans up nice, and is ini grated very well.  I buy things on amazon all the time, and this is my all time favorite buy.  I would never have found it if I were not on amazon.",5,1
PlayTray for the Stokke Tripp Trapp  - Transparent,"I was very impressed when I received the play tray in the mail as it was much heavier, very sturdy and thicker then I antcipated.I have the original Tripp Trapp high chair with the European style infant seat attached and it fit perfectly over the infant insert.  This play tray also has a rectangular metal bar attched underneath and comes with a black strap so you can anchor the play tray to the high chair without the infant seat attched and the strap will go between the childs leggs to keep them from sliding out.I have been using my play tray for a month now with my 9 month old in the infant insert and love it.  I can let him make a mess while eating the simply slide the play tray off and throw the food in the bin and wash the tray properly and slide it back on.For more information this is the website of the company that makes the play tray:[....]",5,1
EZ-Guard 4' Tall Self Closing / Self Latching Pool Fence Gate -Black (EZGate4B),"NOT UP TO CODE REQUIREMENTS, But this will give you peace of mind when you have little ones around.

Be patient, the trial and error method may be more helpful then the instruction.",4,1

"Steribottle Ready to Use Disposable Baby Bottles,  10-Count","I held on to this product for quite a while, almost eight months!My son is now old enough (five months) to be able to use the Steribottle. This is because the nipple on the Steribottle is a fast-flow so you're better off waiting until baby is closer to six months old. Any earlier and you'll waste formula or breast milk and annoy baby.Preparing the bottle was easy: rip open the plastic covering on both the base and the nipple, pour the formula or milk into the base and firmly press the nipple top housing onto the base which is capable of holding 10 ounces. The click sound ensures a seal, but for me, when I shook the bottle for further mixing, the formula spilled out of some unknown opening and all over my hand. After making sure the lid was on tightly after that, it functioned normally afterward.There is a small hole near the base of the nipple housing that lets in air as baby sucks; this is important to reduce air intake--babies really don't like having air trapped somewhere. As far as I could tell, the hole worked well and my son had no more issues with burping with the Steribottle as with any other.In fact, for traveling I really like the Steribottle. It's convenient and easy to use although I have to figure out why it leaked when I shook the formula. Apart from that little hiccup, four stars.",4,1
"Steribottle Ready to Use Disposable Baby Bottles,  10-Count","I bought these bottles to use while on vacation earlier this month and cannot tell you how amazing these bottles are! We were on a 7 days cruise and I wanted to be able to relax and not worry about washing bottles and making sure everything was clean and sanitized.My son had no problem adjusting to these bottles but I do have a couple of small ""complaints"".1. Like many other reviewers the flow of these bottles seem too fast. My son is 8 months and it took him a couple of tries before he got used to it. Until he did, the milk would leak through both sides of his mouth since he wasn't able to swallow it fast enough. However, there were no other leakage issues with these bottles, the seal was incredible!2. I do wish that each bottle and nipple was individually wrapped because they are currently in 2 sets of 5 per box. I know from an environmentally friendly standpoint that would mean waste but since these are bottles that are mostly used for purposes like traveling and not on a regular basis I think that would make a huge difference.",5,1

"Carter's Snuggle Me Pink with Polka Dots 2-pack of Loveys, Security Blankets","My daughter was given these for her shower.  Honestly, I thought they were very strange since they're about the size of a burp cloth.  When I gave them to my daughter at about 3 months to go to bed with, she loved them!  They're the perfect size and very soft.  We needed more since it became a must have for bedtime.",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",The texture is soft but firm for his gums while he is going through the teething era.  I don't have to worry about the banana hurting him. He appears to like it very much.,5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","I am a retired dental hygienist with a 19mos old granddaughter.  When she was younger, she loved to mouth/chew on toothbrushes, and would want to walk around with it.  This is a much safer alternative; the material is flexible, the larger handle easier for her to hold, and you can put it in the dishwasher to clean it.",4,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","Our baby loves this thing - particularly when a tooth is on its way. As a training toothbrush, it seemed to work well, because she has now graduated to a real toothbrush, and is quite happy to get her teeth brushed.",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","I am so glad I bought this baby toothbrush!  My daughter is 7 months old and it is mostly just a teether right now, but I also brush her gums (she hasn't cut any teeth yet) to get her used to having her teeth brushed when she gets them.  She seems to find this very soothing when I do this and she chews on the brush on her own constantly.  The banana peel handles are easy for her to hold and make me feel better about her not being able to choke on it.  Because this toothbrush is silicone, hairs and fuzzes stick to it very easily, but a quick rinse under running water cleans it quickly.  I am so glad I bought this product and have recommended it to other moms, I also think it is great that when she is ready we can graduate to the Toddler Banana Brush next!",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",Its a tie. My 6 month old loves this as much as the born free bendable silicone teether. He likes the octopus alot too but this one usually wins out.,5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","Our pre-teether loves this. She chews on the handles, the bristle side and the bottom point of the banana. Each of those areas have a different texture & shape. I love this item for travel as I can tether it with a pacifier leash and she can be entertained in her car seat or shooing cart.",5,1

"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",Bg liked this chew toy at 6mn of age and so did the dog so i am ordering another.  No issues with it.,4,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",My son got his first tooth at only 3 months and teething has been really rough for him.  We originally bought the banana toothbrush to begin taking care of his new teeth but it ended up taking care of his teeth and being the only teether that will calm him down when his teeth are hurting.  There are other training tooth brushes with a similar design but I think this one is the best choice.  It is made of food grade silicone and the peeled banana design and short ends keep him from choking on the brush at both ends.  The options that are sold at Babies R Us have a longer end which defeats the purpose of the peeled banana design.  This is a great choice for early teethers.,5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","My baby use it almost everyday, he loves it very much, I would like to buy another one for him.",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","My baby is almost 4 months and is just starting the teething process (no tooth buds yet, just getting &#34;chewy&#34;, drooly, and fussy).  He can grab things, but he's certainly not that coordinated yet, so the teething rings that require you to grab 2 sides and bring a middle section to your mouth or something don't really work for him yet.  He really just likes to grasp his fists together and bring them to his mouth.  So this thing is PERFECT!!  It is small and light enough for an early teether to manage and the grasps are close together so he can hold it while using his instinct to just bring both hands to his mouth.  He really likes the feeling of the rubber bristles on his gums and just chomps away on it.  It is also an easy transition because the shape is reminiscent of a pacifier.  In fact he will suck on it too when he just wants a comfort instead of rubbing his gums.  Totally a must have!!",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",my 9 month old loves this--i wish i had this product when she first started teething--she always smiles when i brush her four teeth with this and always chews on it--its a great teether as well,5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",Bought this for my 3-month-old... it's perfect for establishing good habits before their teeth have come in!  She loves brushing time.,5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","Lady Adelynn loved it! It is so darn cute and easy for a 9 month old to hold. I would never spend that much for a toothbrush for myself but did not hesitate buying it for the granddaughter. Also, a great teething toy!",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","The bristles are soft, so it doesn't hurt my daughter's already swollen gums from teething. the banana peels aren't just for decoration. they prevent the &#34;One who Swallows All Things&#34; from sticking the toothbrush further into her mouth than she should. The peels spread out wide enough to make it safe from accidental insertion.",5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",We bought an extra 3 as he kept losing them. My son enjoys brushing his teeth with these. Have also bought for a friend who likes them too.,4,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",I bought this as a gift . He was a little too young as he gagged himself with itCool idea though im sure in time he will get the hang of it,4,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",Our kids love chewing on these. Our teething children can't get enough. It only lasted one per kid though. The bristles started to ware out once the teeth came in and in some cases ripped off. We never had any choking or anything.,5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",My daughter (5 months) can hold this and enjoys chewing it...just like she is easting a banana. It is adorable!,5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",Not tried yet since baby is young. Feel it is not bad....no more. no more ..... nnn nn nn,5,1
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",My little lives this! She sticks this in her mouth that creates a wide enough opening to get a baby toothbrush in and actually brush her teeth! It's awesome!!! I let her chew on it throughout the day- she actually prefers it over Sophie.,5,1
Bummis Reusable Fleece Liners,"I love these so much that after my initial purchase I went back and ordered some more. They are like a super wick, they completely pull all the moisture away from my babies skin. The diaper insert can be full but these fleece liners stay bone dry! Love. Plus they aren't very expensive. You don't get that many on a pack, but it's well worth it to just get a couple packs at once.",5,1

Bloom Alma Mattress Protector Natural Wheat,"I love Bloom products- and to protect your investment, you must buy this mattress pad. Thankfully, it works perfectly, is eco-friendly and I'd use it on her regular crib - if they made them in that size. :)",5,1
Bloom Alma Urban Crib Frame Coconut White,"We bought the Alma Bloom Mini in coconut while I was still pregnant and living in a studio apartment. I loved the crib's style and organic mattress and sheets. Style is a huge part of what makes a small space live able, and I did my best to avoid overly tacky baby gear.When our girl was first born, she slept in the crib pulled right up to the side of our bed. During the day, we'd wheel it easily into her closet nursery. It was so sleek and adorable out in our tiny apartment.Fast forward 8 months, we are still in our studio and our baby girl is still in her mini crib, though we took the wheels off and it now lives permanently in her ""nursery."" She's in the 85th percentile for height and 65th for weight, so she's no shrinking violet, but she loves her crib, and even reaches for it when tired. If she stretches her arms out, they'll go between the slats, but that doesn't seem to be a problem. She usually sleeps on her back or belly with arms stretched over her head, and there's still plenty of room length-wise. She can roll from front to back to front with a little scooting. I'm obviously coming from a different place than the average American's idea of space (3 humans + 1 dog in 400 Sq ft) but baby girl loves it, and we love the style and materials. So glad we made this purchase.",5,1
"Kate Aspen Classic Baby Blocks Favor Boxes with Imprinted Ribbon - Set of 24, Blue",These are high quality little boxes and adorable. I'm very picky and I'm giving my daughter a baby shower and didn't want anything cheap looking. I love these and plan on making some homemade truffles to put inside. Even the ribbon and the little note attached is sooooo cute! Thanks!!!!!,5,1
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Galaxy Grey",Once your little one is too big to be comfortable wrapped an Ergo is the way to go.  I have multiple soft carriers and the Ergo is by far the best and my go to on a daily basis.,5,1
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Galaxy Grey","We purchased this carrier after a recommendation from a friend (parent of twins living in NYC).  They highly recommended the Ergo as the most comfortable carrier for infants and toddlers.  I tried a few others before buying, including the Bjorn, and chose the Ergo Sport.  We've now had our Ergo for almost 6 months, and anytime parents ask me about it I give them my sales pitch.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:-When worn correctly, it puts the weight of the baby on your hips instead of your shoulders and back.  This allows for a longer period of wearing without sore shoulders and back.  The thick padded shoulder straps are also nice, and the backpack-like structure distributes weight nicely in the front or back positions.-Versatile.  With 3 carrying positions and a weight range up to 40 pounds it will be the only carrier you need with an infant or toddler.  I didn't purchase the infant insert, but found that by folding a blanket and using that as the infant insert my baby could sit comfortably.  We also put him in sideways, with both feet out one side until he was big enough to straddle comfortably.  At 4-5 months we felt that he was big enough to straddle and sit in the carrier without stretching his legs.  He loves sitting so close to me while I do things around the house, as well as grocery shopping, sitting in the front position.  We recently began putting it on our backs and he enjoys this also, as he can look around while we walk.  I don't prefer the hip position, because I feel like it throws my balance off, but the front and back positions are great.-My husband even offers to wear it, and it fits both of us well.  It's easy to adjust the straps to each individual.-Being in the Texas heat, you are going to sweat no matter what carrier you use, but we've found the Ergo to breathe pretty well.-The soft-shell form packs nicely into it's little bag, and is really easy to stuff into a suitcase or bag for traveling.-When it gets dirty, just throw it in the washer.  My son loves to suck on the straps while he is in it, so this is nice.  It's also made of a very soft material- comfy for baby's skin.-The sleeping hood is adjustable to fit any height of child and works as a sunshade/privacy shade as well.-Durable construction. Reinforced stitching at tension points ensures that it is safe and stable for your baby.  I feel like it will last for many years.-Our baby loves to be in it!  The first few times he squirmed while I got it adjusted, but once he was settled he usually fell asleep within 30 mins.  Now he is much more aware, but still can be lulled to sleep by the movement and security of being close to mom or dad.  As mentioned before, he likes to suck on the straps and just looks very content when sitting in it.Cons:-A little pricey, but worth the investment.-The sleeping hood is tricky to put on by yourself, if you are wearing the carrier.  Usually my husband can help me attach it, but once or twice I've had to ask someone else for help.-It takes a few practices to feel comfortable putting the carrier on, and putting the baby in, without help.  I practiced over the couch or bed until I felt sure of myself, and now it takes me less than a minute to put him in and adjust everything (no matter where I am).  My husband, who wears it less often, always has me help him load our baby in.  The instructional videos on the ergo website are extremely helpful in showing how to correctly position the baby and adjust the carrier.-There is no zippered pocket on the Sport version for your keys or cell phone.  I purchased the little bag that attaches to the waistband and that works when we don't want to bring the diaper bag along.Overall, this is a fantastic product.  We're very satisfied with our purchase.  It is a great baby carrier and a nice alternative when using a stroller isn't convenient.",5,1
"Label Itz Bandette Cup and Bottle Labels, Zoo Animals",These arrived on time and as expected.  They are great to keep our kids cups labeled anywhere we find ourselves.  Worked as described.  We wrote their names with ink pen and put in dishwasher.  They still have the names on them after many uses.,5,1
"Label Itz Bandette Cup and Bottle Labels, Zoo Animals",I use these daily for my child's bottles for his day care.  They are durable and very handy.  Would recommend,5,1

"Contours Options Tandem Stroller, Ruby","We have had this stroller for almost 1 year for our twins and it is definitely in my top 3 recommended twin items. It turns well and has lots of capacity on the bottom.  Easy to pop baby seats on and folds/unfolds quickly.  It is big, but I can't see how something so sturdy could really be much smaller.  It's convenience and ease of use is worth the size of it.  Now that they are outgrowing the baby carrier car seats, I am really happy to have seats for this stroller and we don't have to buy a different stroller.  The price here with free amazon shipping is unbeatable! (and I did a lot of research before getting it!)",5,1
"Contours Options Tandem Stroller, Ruby","I was very frustrated with the single stroller that I was using, it was a Graco that I could set the carseat right onto. This was great for only one child, but when I had to use it for my baby girl (with the car seat on top), my 2 1/2 year old had to walk or be carried. After reading the reviews I ordered the Contours Tandem Stroller from Amazon and was very happy. Firstly, I was able to put it together myself with no difficulty at all in less than 1 hour while watching both girls  (usually I make my husband do assembly). I use the carseat attachment and one stroller seat facing away. The only thing I don't like is that with the carseat on the stroller, it takes up alot of space and my older girl cannot have her seat reclined all the way. However, I will soon be able to use the other stroller seat for my baby as soon as I am comfortable that her neck is strong enough (very soon). That being said, this stroller is wonderful for anyone with two young kids. It is great for shopping as it is easy to maneuver and it fits down aisles (unlike strollers where the kids sit side by side). There is plenty of storage space under the seats, the seats are comfortable, and it is relatively easy to set the seats up how you want them. It is bulky, but once you get the hang of it its fine. One thing, if you have a small car, you'll need to clean out your trunk before trying to store it there. I have an SUV with a hatchback and have plenty of space, even when I forget to move the stroller before I grocery shop. Overall, I am so glad that I bought this, especially when I'm out with both girls. Having two out in public can be CRAZY, and having them both comfortable in the same stroller, going whichever way I push them is awesome. Good luck!",4,1
"Contours Options Tandem Stroller, Ruby",this is a great double pram fits both my girls 3mths and 14mths very well. super easy to fold and easy to manover in shops. wish i had it earlier.,5,1
Vtech Crystal Sound DECT Digital Monitor Single,"I wasn't completely sure about this monitor until a couple weekends ago when my sister and niece were visiting. My niece slept in my son's crib, and he slept in our room in his pack-n-play (he's only 8 weeks now). While my son was napping, I very easily moved the baby unit into our room without having to unplug it from the wall (we did have to supply our own batteries for the baby unit though.. no big deal!). I told my sister right then I LOVE this monitor for that fact! We haven't had any problems with it being too soft - I can even hear my son breathing. When I have it turned down to the middle volume level, I have to put it to my ear, but with it completely turned up, I can be getting ready in our bathroom and hear him breathing with the monitor sitting on our counter.  I can hear him breathing in the middle of night (when our surroundings are very quiet) with it turned down to the 3rd level, though. The only things I don't really like about it is how loud it beeps when you turn the volume up or down on the parent unit, or turn it off. I'm also not crazy about the melody it plays when you turn the baby unit on, but we keep ours on, so it's not a problem.  Also agree with another reviewer: I can't stand the first lullaby it plays(the lady singing is just awful!), but the rest of the lullabies are quite pretty! :) As I'm writing this, I can hear my husband doing yard work through the monitor, as well! Oh my! I think it's a great product, and agree with someone else's comment on Babies R Us: maybe some monitors out there got missed in quality control and that's why people are complaining they can not hear anything. Ours has been excellent!",5,1
Teething Bling Pendant - Donut Shape (Bronze),"My daughter is in 6th grade now and has Asperber's.  She has oral fixation issues and tends to chew on anything she can get her hands on to calm herself.  We bought this recently on the advice of her Occupational Therapist.  It looks like a piece of jewelry that she would wear normally.  The other kids don't know what it is for and she can chew on it when she has to instead of tearing up paper or chewing on her clothes/pencils, etc...  This should also be good for when she gets another set of braces in the next year as it cannot get underneath the wires.",5,1
"Dreambaby Retractable Gate, White",This gate has been perfect for our hard to fit stairway.  We have had it for over a year now and it has stood up well.  I especially like that it is out of the way when we do not need it.  I would buy this product again in a heartbeat.,5,1
"Dreambaby Retractable Gate, White","Looks good and is a minimal eye sore compared to standard gates.  This works good at keeping our dog from going upstairs.  I'm certain it is impossible to do one handed since you have to push and rotate the dial and then pull the screen closed. If you don't push and rotate while you open it, it is pretty loud but if you take the extra step to push and rotate it open, it's virtually silent.",4,1
"Dreambaby Retractable Gate, White",My In-laws have wide doorways and we needed a way to keep the kids away from the stairs. Neither kid can get it open but its not hard for grown ups. It withstands a lot of abuse from the kids. We looked for a long time and this was the perfect solution.,5,1
"Dreambaby Retractable Gate, White","Love this gate.  I get compliments and comments on it from all of my guests.  I use it at the top of the stairs in a bi-level home, so we use it all of the time to come and go.  When it's not in use, it retracts into this skinny roll (tube) that hides behind our banister.  This is worth all of the negatives for me to be able to fold and hide a baby gate since it is the first thing you see when you walk through our front door, and I don't want to have a huge gate swinging around in our already cramped house.The gate itself is like a thick white mesh-like material.  It seems well made.  My dogs have attempted to tear it down several times when they get excited about a visitor and it has held up to 90+ lb dogs trying to put their paws up on it.I know a lot of the reviews say it requires 2 hands to open and close, but I never use 2 hands.  It's a 2 step process (first to unlock the gate, then to pull the gate open or closed), but you can do the two steps with one hand.  I am easily able to open and close this gate with one hand  with baby in the other arm.It does have some downsides: 1) it's not exactly great for top of the stair safety.  Since it bends and is flexible, I am pretty sure that my 10 month old baby could squeeze herself under it.  I keep a close eye on that.  2) It's noisy when it retracts if you don't use 2 hands at once 3) the screws it came with are worthless.  Easy solution is to use different screws. 4) the process to open and close is not simple, so frequently, you have to try several times to get the unlock/open sequence right if you are using 1 hand.It seems like a lot of negatives, but for me, the ability to retract and hide the gate away when not in use and to not have to have a big gate swinging around all of the time is worth it to us.",4,1
"Dreambaby Retractable Gate, White",I originally bought a metal gate that swings open.  The opening was small and I had to step over the bottom bar.  This retractable gate only intrudes about 6 inches into the opening and is hardly noticeable when it is open.  The metal gate was there even when the baby was not.  I will only buy retractable gates from now on.,5,1
Nosefrida Nasal Aspirator with addtional 20 Hygiene Filters,"I was a little leery about this at firs, but my son came home from daycare with his first cold and this did the trick!  He was a little startled, but could breath so much better!  Works much better than the bulbs.",5,1

Nosefrida Nasal Aspirator with addtional 20 Hygiene Filters,"clears the snot wonderfully.  The filter is useless (and just rinse it out-why buy more???) but, I figure that if you're snuggling your baby while he/she is sick, sucking the snot out won't really increase your infection risk-you're already exposed.",5,1
Nosefrida Nasal Aspirator with addtional 20 Hygiene Filters,"1.  Amazing.2.  Wish I had found this for my first child.3.  Wish I had found this for my second child before she was 10 months old.So, this thing is incredible, it should be part of a 'going home' package for new parents at their birthing place.  I am going to include this in any baby shower gift I give, going forward.The nosefrida is a relief after all the time spent with the bulb syringe, which took forever and did not get everything out!  Cleaning it is pretty simple, I've just flushed it with warm soapy water and changed the little filter.",5,1
Nosefrida Nasal Aspirator with addtional 20 Hygiene Filters,If you are continuing to torture yourself and child with an old fashioned bulb suction stop now and buy this device. This helps your new born breathe and sleep better in less time than it takes to clean one nostril with a squeeze bulb. This is my first review with my first child and I recommend this and wish I had seen it sooner. It would have been more rest for the baby and more peace of mind for us parents.,5,1
"Mommy's Helper Step Up Non-Slip Stepstool Froggie Collection, Green","I was looking for a light-weight stool so my son could reach the sink for hand washing.  I wanted him to be able to easily move it around to also use the toilet and turn on the light.  He likes the look of the stool and is able to move it like I'd hoped.The only issue is that because it is so light, it can flip over.  I guess that's the pay off.  I hasn't been an issue as he's a bit older and has better balance but I wouldn't use it with a younger child who might fall.",4,1

Cool Gear Travel Potty,LOVE this potty. When my son has to go #2 when we're out the very idea of dragging my 1 year old daughter and and my son into some random bathroom makes my head explode. Instead I move the passenger front seat all the way forward and set this up on the floor of the back seat. Just roll down the windows and the whole family can hang out in the comfort of the car. Thank God for this potty.NOTE FOR BOYS: you must get your son to carefully tuck his you know what under the rim of the seat after he sits down or you will have pee everywhere. Sounds like a pain but no big deal for us.,5,1
Cool Gear Travel Potty,"Where has this been all my life???? This is THE ultimate travel potty.  I store some paper towels, wipes, and gallon bags in the side storage.  Then I just unfold the legs, add a paper towel and we are ready to go.  Once the child uses the potty I ziplock it closed.  The paper towels soak up the liquid, and I toss it in the nearest trash.  I added this to the trunk of my minivan and it has been a life saver.  With older ones on the go to practice, etc this is a life saver with the toddler.  No more auto flusher trauma and drama with a toddler for me!",5,1
Cool Gear Travel Potty,"Can't go anywhere without it.  It's very useful when you just potty train your toddler.  I Just leave it in the van and whenever she needs to go, I just let her sit in the back of the van. Got a box of 1 gallon ziplock bags and some baby wipe to store in the storage box.  Highly recommended!!!",5,1

Highly recommended for any parents who want a photographic record of their baby's growth.",5,1
"Icy Diamond Tote - Small Insulated Bag for insulin, snacks, teethers (Blue)","This bag seems to have been made to fit Snickers bars (1.86 oz size); I can squeeze in at least 10!Specs:- 8.36 oz without strap/clip- 5 3/4"" by 6/34"" and 2.5"" deep- Shoulder strap- Belt clip- Small outside pocket for id, money, information, etc...Pros:- Keeps food and snacks icy cold!- Lightweight- Small footprint- Long lasting during high-heat hikes (90 degrees)- DurableCons:- NoneI was searching for a small cooler bag to keep my Snickers bars cold during summer hikes. Snickers are one of the better food sources when you're on the trail (lightweight, full of sugar, and cheap). However, on hot hikes (80-90 degrees), the Snickers bars turn to soup (and this is after they've been frozen solid in the freezer). With the Icy Diamond Tote, they stayed cold for 6 hours (my longest hike) during 80-85 degree temperatures!Unbelievable, this little tote is lightweight (8.36 oz without strap/clip) 5 3/4"" by 6/34"" and 2.5"" deep (by my measurements). The cold packs stay cold to the touch and the insulation is awesome. The zipper works well and the material is tough. Not much more to say, this is a great product-I've been recommending to all my hiking friends!",5,1
"Nuby 2 Pack Nurtur Care Infa Feeder Set, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I used an Infa Feeder with my son years ago and loved it. I thought my granddaughter would love one for her son but this one is a little different from the one I used. Mine was smaller and easier for him to hold and the suction was better.It came in handy for me with my son cause he would always hit the spoon and most of his food landed on the floor. I mixed applesauce with oatmeal and he ate a lot more.My great grandson learned to eat from a spoon and didn't really need it..but it's always good on trips or when going to restaurants.,4,1
"Nuby 2 Pack Nurtur Care Infa Feeder Set, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I used this for my now 5 year old daughter. You have so many options to find out what your baby will eat off of and for their first time cereal feeding this is super. Put my little one in a food coma lol,4,1
"Nuby 2 Pack Nurtur Care Infa Feeder Set, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary",This is a great product and leaves no mess. This was not quite what I was looking for but they got the job done. They were stiff and hard for my grand-daughter to suck the food through. I would look for a different brand even though NUBY is a great product. Not the sellers fault.,4,1
"Nuby 2 Pack Nurtur Care Infa Feeder Set, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I looked for these in every store and finally found them on here after I was told they dont even make them anymore. They got here sooner than anticipated.  They were in perfect condition. They cost more than I expected them to but they were so worth it.,5,1
Kid-ding Waterproof Crib Pads - 2 Pack - 27&quot; x 50&quot;,"Originally bought this product to protect my baby's crib mattress. But when the mattress arrived I was pleased to discover it had it's own protective waterproof zipper-sealed cover. So I decided to keep it should I have use for it later on. Well this week I ran out of wee wee pads for my puppy and so did my local drugstore. So in a moment of desperation I decided to use the waterproof pads as wee wee pads. Lo and behold they worked amazingly!!! They're super absorbent, don't allow drainage off the edges, keeps my floors dry, saves money (reusable) -- just wash with a little soap and bleach to sanitize, drys fast (air dry or on low heat in dryer). So now I'm back to order a couple more packs. With this product I will no longer spend a fortune on wee wee pads. And once my puppy is house broken I'm sure I'll find an alternate use for the pads later on down the road. Yep, GREAT PRODUCT !!!!",5,1
Kid-ding Waterproof Crib Pads - 2 Pack - 27&quot; x 50&quot;,"I love that this comes in a 2 pack for a very reasonable price.  (You're going to need at least 2, so I wonder why more mattress pads aren't sold in pairs.) I've been using these for a couple months now and they have done the job with minor blowouts, though I can't speak to potty-training messes just yet. They fit the top of a standard size mattress well.  The backside is completely waterproof, and by the way, NOT reversible (not sure why they make this claim). One star off though because they are impossibly thin -- practically just a stiff sheet.  I was hoping they'd be a bit ""cushier"", since they are called ""pads"" after all, but this is just a minor annoyance.",4,1
"The Deluxe Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Denim)","It is the best option for those of us who struggle with swaddling.  You only have to do it once and they are swaddled through the night!  It helps them sleep through the night better.  Love, love, love the woombie!  The downfall is that everyone thinks the baby is to confined and always wants to unzip halfway don't they realize that baby just came from a way more confined spot and might be missing a little of there temporary home.",5,1
"The Deluxe Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Denim)","The woombie is absolutely amazing!  Both my babies LOVED being swaddled.  With my first, I used the Swaddle Designs blanet and loved that it was big, but at 3 1/2 months, I could only swaddle my baby's arms.  With my second baby (now 6 1/2 months), I used Aiden and Anais...  I LOVE these blankets too for many reasons, but my baby at 2 weeks old would always work his arms up and out, no matter how tight I wrapped him (and I wrapped him crazy tight).  I would end up having to re-wrap him multiple times during the night, because he'd keep himself (and me) awake otherwise.  I found the Woombie 2 months ago.  My baby LOVES the woombie!  (and so do I!)  It allows him to move his arms inside, but he can't get his arms out.  He sleeps much better at night as a result!  He can move around his crib in it and even onto his tummy, but can roll back to his back or side if he wants to.  I tried zipping only his legs to see if he could sleep with his hands free - he cried and cried so I decided to zip him all the way up - he fell asleep as I was zipping him!  Since having the woombie, when it is bed or nap time, all I need to do is put him in the Woombie, lay him in his crib and leave and he falls to sleep right away...  I'm already planning on buying the ""mega baby"" size!",5,1
"The Deluxe Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Denim)",I bought this for my little girl.  She slept very well in it.  It allows her to still move her arms and legs but keeps her cozy.  Great buy.,5,1
"The Deluxe Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Denim)","I only bought a Woombie when my son was 4 months old (Big Baby size)and I really wish I had started with them!I have swaddled my baby from day 1 at home. Originally, I used Aden and Anais swaddling blankets, but my husband couldn't swaddle those tight enough to stay on him. In looking for an instant swaddle solution, I took the economic route and bought SwaddleMe/Kiddopatamus swaddles with the velcro wings. They actually worked fine until about 2.5 months when our son got stronger and started busting out of the velcro. I had an opportunity to buy a Woombie at a reduced cost and we couldn't be more thrilled.Pros:-Husband can operate!-easier to get feet into and do diaper changes than the SwaddleMe velcro swaddles-laundry friendlier than velcro swaddles that end up sticking to everything in the wash-easier to get active arms into-baby can still move arms around in the swaddle without busting out-not ""tight"" even though it's form-fittingOur son is now 5 months old and wants to put his hands in his mouth all the time. The Woombie actually allows him to do that even with his hands in the swaddle - he just puts his swaddled hands in his mouth! We have had no problems with him being scratched by the velcro, as others have mentioned.Bottom line is that I HIGHLY recommend Woombies, even though they are more expensive than velcro wing swaddles. They are SO worth it! How many times have you tried several cheap things and not been quite happy or just ended up having to buy the more expensive one later? Try the Woombie first - I wish I had!",5,1
"Graco Quattro Tour Travel System, Sutton","We love this set.  This is the best deal I could find on this system and came with free shipping.  It took my husband and I less than a half hour to put the stroller together.  This is the top rated travel system on the market.  We love the structure on the stroller its solid and strudy and so easy to maneuver. Weighs about 20-25 lbs and is easily folded up for storage.  The Car seat easily latches into the stroller and locks at both the front and the back of the seat.  There are several adjustments on the stroller for a full recline to removable tray for baby.  The storage compartment is very roomy and folds down for easy access when seat is fully reclined.  The pattern for this system is great could definately be for a girl or boy, with a more modern pattern.  Fabric is easily wipeable while still be soft and comfortable.  I love the base for the car seat.  its kind of tricky to get latched into the car, but once in is super convenient and easy to use.  The car seat also allows for standard seat belt to cross over the top of the car seat and strap in for easy use in vehicles without the base.  Definately think we made the right choice.  I'm at 7 months and can see us using this system for years to come.",5,1

"Fisher-Price Playtime Bouncer, Precious Planet","I purchased this for a shower gift after using one with my three kids.  My kids loved being in it.

Fisher-Price Precious Planet Sky Blue High Chair,"This chair looks complex and intimidating at first, but I soon came to realize that's because when you put your child into it they get sucked into an inter-dimensional vortex that sends them back in time. Usually it's great fun (my daughter loves playing with the dinosaurs!), but be careful. [...]",5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Sky Blue High Chair,"It's a great chair. It rolls great. Has 3 positions. However, the directions for putting this together were very unclear and unprofessionally written. I put the chair facing backward and it didn't align with the screw holes on the base. I had to remove it and install it again the other way. 10 Minute job turned into 1 hour cause of poor instructions.",4,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Sky Blue High Chair,Really recommend this one. My daughter loves sitting on it. I have another wooden high chair which can hurt my baby when she starts to cry and tries to get out of the chair but this one is not hard like woods.The fabric is easy to clean and the removable try is very convenient.,5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Sky Blue High Chair,"I received this highchair as a baby shower gift. I started using it when the baby was 6mo and I really love it. It has 7 different heights, so you can set it up on the most convenient for you. The pad wipes clean, so I wash it very rarely. The design is cute and the baby loves the toy. The second we sit him in the chair he knows it's feeding time. Since the very beginning he knew that the chair is for feeding and was ready and responsive.",5,1
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Sky Blue High Chair,She loves it!  And it keeps her busy while mom is cooking for the family or cleaning the house during the day.,5,1
Fisher-Price Sea Turtle Trainer Ring,"I bought this potty ring for my daughter and she really likes it!  It fits easily into the toilet and secures so I don't have to worry about it moving.  It pulls back out very easily too.  My daughter sits on this without a problem and seems to enjoy the little face.  We do have to watch how she sits just to make sure her legs are on either side of the little head but this hasn't really been a problem so far.  We also have a potty seat which she enjoys but she likes playing with it more than actually using it.  The potty ring has been nice because she can't just get up immediately after sitting down, so she actually has a chance to go potty!",4,1
Fisher-Price Sea Turtle Trainer Ring,This potty is great! So cute! One piece makes it easy to clean. Comfy. Great for a boy and you can't beat the price. I took away one star for not having a loop to hang it up.,4,1
Fisher-Price Sea Turtle Trainer Ring,"I love this because we're tight on space in our bathroom, so I didn't want to get a separate potty seat.  My daughter doesn't love it though, all she wants to do is scoot back on the seat and put her feet in the toilet :/  We'll see if this actually works once she starts using the potty more.",4,1

"Jeep Backpack Harness, Lion",makes being outdoors a pleasure..I can even put it on before I put him in his stroller and take him out to walk whenever I want.  i take the bus so this helps me juggle everything without worrying he'll run off. He also doesn't hold me personal when he reaches the end of his leash..he just turns around and changes his course to follow me...great!,5,1

NoJo 2 Pack Dot Changing Table Cover - Ivory withSnow Dots,"Good product, but not super great. It fits the standard changing pad fairly well, it just feels a little thin as compared to some of the other ones I've tried. However, for the price, I feel like it was worth it.

Every store I went to the pad covers cost at least $12.99 or more for only one cover and most of those were plain looking. I even had trouble just finding them at some stores. The Nojo covers fit my pad perfectly and washing them was a snap! I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys style for a great value!,5,1
Mod Pod Pop Jungle Bassinet,"We just received this bassinet. Like the other review we had some issues with the wheels. We were able to get three in with no problem, but the forth one broke. No worries, we don't plan on moving it around. Very sturdy, good quality, nice size and very attractive.",5,1
Mod Pod Pop Jungle Bassinet,"We have been using this for 6 weeks now with no big problems.  I am dinging it one star because of two minor disappointments and one aesthetic irritation.  1) I didn't have trouble installing the wheels as other people have mentioned, but they aren't particularly good at rolling--they're a bit stiff.  I do wish the wheels worked better (mostly for moving back and forth to soothe back to sleep in the middle of the night).  2) For some reason, I thought that this would swing a bit more like a hammock (again for soothing purposes).  Not so, but my assumption and not something they claimed.  3) This last is minor, but might bug some people:  the stickers indicating which part is which (A, B, C, etc.) are really hard to get off.  We've ended up leaving most of them on.  It's in our bedroom and in use for a short period of time so it's not a big deal.Since these things are not a big deal to me and this was a much better price than similar bassinet set-ups available and we will be using the bassinet for just about 3 months, I am overall very happy with the bassinet.I do not see what the reviewers talking about mattress stability are talking about.  The bassinet comes with a board that you are supposed to insert into the mattress cover to make a stiff backing.  I thought, in fact, that it was so stiff that I have added a mattress pad to make it more comfortable.  The velour sheet that comes with it is very soft and has held up well in the laundry.  I purchased a couple of additional ones but the one that comes with it is the nicest one we have.",4,1
Ergo Baby BCP03405 Performance Carrier With a LED Safety Reflector Light - Grey,I finally had the freedom I needed when I got my Ergo Baby carrier. OMG. Best baby product ever!!

"MAM Triple Pack Baby Bottle, 4 Months, 11 Ounce, Colors May Vary",this was a great buy my only problem is that it seems to be a online product because i couldnt find them anywhere but online which is ok but when it can time to replacing the nipples i would rather pick them up at the store than waiting a wk on shipping.

Dreambaby Toy Chain,"This isn't really a TOY to speak of; it's a hanger for stuffed animals.  It's perfect because it comes with the hook to hang it, a really long chain so no matter how tall your ceilings are it should work fine, AND there were lots of clips for the animals.  I bought three; one for my daughter who is expecting, and two for our Thrift Shop so that we could hang up all the stuffed animals that are for sale.  It takes up so little room yet allows you to see everything at a glance.  GREAT for cleaning up baby's room or decluttering your teenager's place!",5,1
Potty Scotty Potty Chair,"My son is 3 3/4 years old. I just started potty training him. He immediately went to his blue potty chair and used it.That is, he can use this potty chair very well. It is a single piece that once it is used, it has to be wiped and clean or rinse in the sink. No hassle. I really love this piece. Plan to use it as a portable one and see how it goes.",5,1
"Serena &amp; Lily Deluxe Peacock Diaper Tote, Army Green","It would take me too long to describe how much I like this bag.  I have been on the road for almost 6months with my toddler and baby, and it has gone everywhere with me!  It is fashionable and practical in equal measure.  Yet it is not flashy, (no one will tell how much you have paid for it), and here in South America, I find that a great advantage!!  Before buying it I looked all over for pictures of the inside, couldn't find them!! But it has all the pockets I need, even a little protecting pouch for the buckle once you are ready to toss the bag in the washer!!, two perfectly sized for diapers, two for bottles, one for clean clothes, two more for extras.  I just love it.  The color is a beautiful military green that goes with (almost) everything, esp. well with our Eddie Bauer stroller.  I was worried about it not having a zipper closure, and even thought I might want to have one put on, but so far it hasn't been an issue, not once have I dropped a single bib/sock/toy in it.  Trust me it is worth every penny!!!  Thanks Serena & Lily for crafting such high quality product!!",5,1
"Thinkbaby New Stage III - Cross Cut - Fast Flow - with Venting System, Natural, 6 to 12 Months","These nipples were a life saver for my infant.  After 2 weeks of painful, messy feedings with Dr. Browns, I tried ThinkBaby - what a difference!  My baby could drink and not choke.  I have used all stages of the cross cut nipples.  I love it, because it isn't messy; these nipples do not leak.  When baby sucks on the nipple, it opens the cross-cut design; no sucking, means no flow.  Not 5 stars due to collapsing nipple issue; I cut the bottom of the vent to allow more air (this takes care of the collapsing nipple problem).",4,1
"Trend Lab Kenya Musical Mobile, Pink","the colors were pretty and exactly what I expected.  we have had this item for several months.  the songs are skipping some notes now but not noticeable by someone who is not musically trained.  be careful for when your baby can reach it, the giraffes are easily pulled out from the plastic T under the umbrella piece.  the giraffe will have the ribbon attached to it when and if pulled out which can or could be a choking hazard.  the price was great.  this mobile was exactly what I wanted when I got it and has served its purpose.  it was pretty cheap and all I wanted was something not too flashy or crazy in pink and brown.",4,1
"Keekaroo Karoo Lightweight Stroller, Lilac Mist","My husband and I routinely mull over purchases FOREVER, and rarely buy anything that we haven't physically seen/held/tested.  However, after looking at many strollers, and leaning towards the Mclaren, I was still uneasy about shelling out $240 for an umbrella stroller.  So, after revisiting the keekaroo many times and ready the stellar reviews, I decided to order it.  It really has many of the features I missed in my old stroller - a reasonably sized, accessible basket, a great reclining seat, a fold up footrest for my 9 month old, and a large canopy with clear window.  The stroller steers really nicely, it seems well constructed, and my son seems very comfortable in it.  The handles are tall, which don't bother me (I am 5'1"") and are nice for my husband (he is 6'3"").  The only 2 minor issues are the lack of a cup holder (I ordered the sunshine kids stroller accessory buggy for like $9 which solves this problem) and that it is pretty bulky when folded, taking up quite a bit of room in the truck of my sedan.  Overall, an exceptional purchase!!",5,1
Wingbo - Tummy Time Swing,"I  have been  using  the Wingbo in my  Pediatric Physical Therapy practice for a few years. I use the  swing daily. I have  had  several clients with  a variety of issues from torticollis to heart disease to  low tone to CP gain head control and even  start  to  tolerate  belly time for the first time in their lives! We also offer open play at our clinic, a time for typically and atypically developing  kids to interact. Our typically developing babies/kids also enjoy the Wingbo. I initially  had a problem adjusting the ropes and they worked with me to remedy the situation. Their customer service was exceptional.  I understand it is expensive, but The Wingbo has the advantage of use for kids up  to 6 years/75# when using the long ropes. This is especially  beneficial for  kids with special needs who may need several years to  master belly time skills. It has been a great investment for my practice!",5,1
"Disney Princess And The Frog 4 piece Toddler Set, Light Blue",We got this for my daughter and have been really happy with it so far. The colors are very cool and she loves it. The materials are well made and the fabric soft. She is happy with it so we are happy with it.,5,1

"Medela Slow Flow Wide Base Nipple, 3pk/0-4 months",I bought this when my grandson was born for hhis house. He liked these so much I bought some for grammy's house.,5,1
"Medela Slow Flow Wide Base Nipple, 3pk/0-4 months","These work great for us.  They are the only nipples we use.  When my daughter was about 4 months old, she started sucking harder and faster and the nipple would collapse and become ineffective.  When that happens, it's time to switch to the faster flow.  We now use the Medium Flow, and those are working great for us.",5,1
"Medela Slow Flow Wide Base Nipple, 3pk/0-4 months","I had saved all of my bottles from my Birth in 2008.  I was getting ready for baby no 2 and I decided to throw away all the old nipples.  I then read that the older collars and nipples were not compatible with the newer collar and nipples.  I threw away all the old collars and sent my mother to Babies R Us for new collars and more nipples.  We ended up buying more bottles too, it was just more cost effective.  I like being able to pump straight into the bottles the baby will use. I have the Medela Pump in Style 2007 model.",5,1
"L A Baby Cocoon Organic Changing Pad, Gold, 32&quot;","I always read the reviews of products before I purchase an item. I read the reviews for this product which stated the following problems: torn seam, bunched up inner cotton batting, odd chemical smell, unable to find size appropriate covers and fabric not as shown on amazon (which also included a pic of what the fabric did look like). I then found this item for a discounted price ($20.15 due to open box...most likely a returned product) and because I liked the jaquard pattern and color another customer photo had shown (matches our nursery theme perfectly) decided I was willing to chance the problems. I placed the order on June 20 and received it on June 22. That was the free super saver shipping and NOT two day shipping so I was highly impressed that I received it so quickly. Upon opening the product I did indeed find that the inner cotton batting was bunched up at one end of the mat under the jaquard cover (which was as the cutomer photo had depicted). I also noted that there was a small opening about an inch long in the seam at the bottom corner of one end (this was not a tear but simply where the thread was unravelling). I used this to my advantage and picked out the threading along the entire end. I was then able to reach under the jaquard cover and straighten out the quilted cotton batting and then resewed the end securely. This entire process took me about 1/2 an hour. If I had not been able to repair the problem myself in such a short period of time it would not have been worth it, but any novice seamstress will find that this problem is easily fixed. It is a really nice changing pad both visually and functionally. This is a larger pad but I wanted a larger one so that it could be used for a longer duration. You can find covers to fit it using most any search engine including the length in your search. However, the product already has a cover on it (the jaquard fabric). It is not washable, but you only need to purchase waterproof pads which are much cheaper than a cover anyways. Finally, I did not notice any sort of odd chemical smell coming from this product. That was actually the first thing I checked for as such a thing would have caused me to immediately return it. Overall, given that I was able to fix the minor problems with this product, purchased it at a reduced price and received it so quickly I gave it 4 stars. I would not recommend this product to someone who has no sewing skills or does not know someone who could do the repairs for them as given the other reviews it is likely that the product will need some alterations.",4,1

"Bumkins Grande Diaper Bag, Dr. Seuss","I love this bag.  After an exhaustive search for something that wasn't too big or small, I found this bag that also stands on it's own which I love.  It has a ribbon on top for a tie closure and I thought I would hate that but it hasn't bothered me at all.",5,1
Dandelion Pink Organic Toy Bunny Blanket,"I don't write reviews often but this bunny has been the single most important object to my almost 4 year old, since she was 6 months old. It has weathered daily use for about 3.5 years and frequent washing. Aside from the pink fading, the bunny is still in great shape and softer than ever. We used it as a sleep cue for my daughter and it worked great. She still sleeps with it for both naps and night time. It has been an irreplaceable comfort and a sleep buddy for her. We actually have a total of 3 so we always have a back up somewhere:)",5,1

"Lifefactory Solid Cap 2 Pack, White","it worked how I needed it, worked as a lid for my babies life factory bottle so it wouldn't spill on trips.",5,1
"Lifefactory Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Lilac","This is the best teething ring I've found (after 4 kids).  Unlike most, it is very flexible and somewhat soft, so it doesn't hurt baby's gums when she chews on it.  She can also bend it easily and get to whichever part of her gums are bothering her.  Although I describe it as ""somewhat soft"" it isn't going to wear out or fall apart.  It does like to collect lint and fuzz off the floor, but it easily washes clean.  I would highly recommend buying this instead of wasting money on a half dozen others that won't get used. Unfortunately we lost our first one somewhere, so I'm ordering another because now with molars coming we definitely need this flexibility to reach her back gums.",5,1
"Lifefactory Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Lilac","This is the best teether we have tried so far, at least for the stage my son is at. He really likes to chew around the rim of hisThe First Years Newborn Pacifiers - 2 Pack, so that should have been my first clue that he likes to chew on medical-grade silicone best. As soon as I handed it to him, he loved it. And was crawling and rolling around with it in one hand--something I have not seen him do with any other toy. He really does seem to like the different textures on the teether as well. I also bought theMunchkin Fun Ice Soothing Ring Teether, Colors May Varyand thePhilips AVENT Range BPA-Free Front Teeth Teether, Animal. He has not been as taken with them as he is with this Lifefactory one, but that could change as different teeth emerge, so I'm not returning the other ones or saying don't try the other ones, I'm just reporting that babies who were given Soothie pacifiers might prefer the texture of the silicone to other teethers.",5,1
"Lifefactory Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Lilac","My baby LOVES this teether, and I wish I would have had it for my first 2 children.  It looks like a traditional teething ring, but the material is completely different than you might expect from the picture.  As other reviews mentioned, it's extremely flexible and lightweight but also durable.  I have purchased it as a gift, which is one of the best recommendations you can give!",5,1
"Dandelion Organic Plush Toy, Bear","i wish i wouldve reead the description a little closer it was a bit smaller than i expected its a great size though for kids under 5, it also has a little rattle in it which isnt bad it was just unexpected. VERY well made even though it cost me 20 dollars its something i highly believe will hold together and my kids kids kids could someday enjoy it.",4,1
"Dandelion Organic Plush Toy, Bear","Just the cutest little addition to the nursery. Finding organic plush toys aren't always easy, and when you do they often look very &#34;earthy&#34; if you know what I mean. He's on the smaller side for a teddy bear (I don't think I really noted the dimensions when I ordered) but perfect for little hands.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart weePOD, Green","Very Sturdy, Easy to Clean, Easy to remove and replace. Our daughter feels safe while using the seat which is important for allowing her to focusing on other things (if you know what I mean)...",5,1
"Prince Lionheart weePOD, Green","My 4 year old is on the spectrum and has some mild sensory issues- but enough so that he did not want to sit on the Bjorn seat (""It hurts my butt!"").  He will sit on this seat, since it is much softer than the others we have tried.  We've got work ahead of us, but we have had more success in the 2 weeks it has arrived than we have had over the last year.  In fact, he promptly gave me his old Bjorn seat (purchased because it had more room & larger opening for an almost 5-year old) and asked me to put it in the attic.  I would highly recommend this product.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart weePOD, Green","The WeePod arrived in such good time that I feel that even the UPS Delivere did not mind havinging this arrive to our home.  It has such great easy packaging and it assembles to any seat after removal of your toilet coverings, majestically.  The color in ash gray works with any other color as the rime of the seat has a stylized white bordering.  The handle looks great as well and I bet as child learn to use more than one potty conscious rememberings about being on this potty in training will also help and assist in manners as they uise other potties, even public potties where the toilet coverings are less majestic and open.  The cushioning is great and rigid and will teach children to not coo!! so much while on the potty for the shape and support it gives (rather like a saddle, here) but it also teaches spine reinforcement.  Best to all who come to use Prince Lionheart potties.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown","These are exactly what we wanted to keep our 18 month old from hitting her head on the coffee table.  They are a very generic brown color which blends with almost all of the """"medium brown"""" furniture we have.  The double sided tape is quite sturdy and holds the pads on even with little hands trying to pull them off.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown","These corners were perfect for the sharp edges on my platform bed.  Also, my husband was concerned that they would damage the finish but the adhesive is by 3M and it says to just use vegetable oil to take it off of wood, so it sounds pretty easy.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown","Easy to use, easy to install and they STAY ON. Like that they are a dark brown color and blend with many of our dark wood furniture pieces. The best thing about these is that they are much less bulky than some of the other versions and provide the same level of protection. They actually almost blend in with the woodwork instead of sticking out like a sore thumb. Kids also are less likely to try to pull them off because they blend in with the furniture so well.",5,1
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown","The corner guards are working well for us and I have recommended them to friends. Very easy to put on. They really stick though, so attach tightly at the corner first and then press the sides down firmly. If you remove and reattach they don't adhere as well. We are using them on our kitchen table, island, and living room side table and they've saved my son's head several times already (2 years old). He was curious at first but now ignores them. For removal, try using Goo-Gone. It's non toxic and works great on all kinds of sticky residues.",4,1
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown",I never knew these existed so when I found them I was very happy now no longer getting bruises ever time I walk past a bed in the guest room,5,1
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown",The corners seem to reasonably well made. I bought them to use on the sharp corners of my barbecue grill shelves to keep from tearing the canvas cover.,5,1
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown","Great product, worked as advertised.  The stickiness could be better, since my child already pulled one off, but other than that it works great.",5,1
"superMOPI Toddler Motorbike Ride-on Toy - metal blue, XL size","I was on Amazon looking for another ride-on toy for my 2 yr old when I ran across this superMopi.  I read reviews for hours and watched numerous videos.  I was hesitant because I had never heard of or seen a superMopi - plus $50 seemed like alot for a small plastic toy.  He really needed something to play with while outside with his sisters and all the neighborhood kids.  We recently purchased him a Strider balance bike, but he was not doing very well on it.  When it arrived, I was prepared (from reading all the reviews) to not be phased by the seemingly small, light weight toy.  It took a few days for my son to really get the hang of riding his mopi, but when he did, he was flying all over the place.  Even his 6 yr old sister was scooting around on it.  When we take it to the park, all the kids want a turn on his mopi.  It is a hit for sure and the best ride-on toy out there!  The best part, after several weeks on his mopi, he has gained mad balancing skills and is fully riding his Strider balance bike and his big sister's Razor scooter.  We are amazed at the drastic improvement of his coordination since he started riding his superMopi. Highly recommend!",5,1

Babysoy Unisex Baby Oh Soy Bundler - Eggplant - 0-3 Months,"We chose not to find out the sex of our baby and purchased this outfit for the baby to wear home from the hospital.  The gown made hospital check out a breeze because we could just pull out a foot whenever they needed to check the ankle ID.  The fabric is very soft and a good thickness.  The fabric hold up well, so it looks like this piece will become an heirloom that all out babies will come home in!  I agree with the previous poster that it is not as long as other sacks.  Our baby was only 19.5"" at birth and her feet poked out when she stretched out.",4,1

Summer Infant Extra Camera For Day and Night Flat Screen Color Video Monitor,"We purchased the camera and monitor together and used it for our first child. We then purchased the extra camera with our second child and now use the monitor to see our 2 children (now ages 3 and 1) by switching between the A/B channels. Gives peace of mind that you can see exactly what they are doing. Once my daughter moved from her crib to a bed, we just mounted the camera at the highest point possible so we can see 80% of her room. The other one is mounted to where we can see the entire crib. Would highly recommend!",5,1
"Gund Baby Nighty Night Musical Toy, Blue","My next door neighbor is expecting a baby in June, I purchased this the moment I saw it online.  She and her husband both said they think it is adorable.

Infant Airplane Seat - Flyebaby Airplane Baby Comfort System - Air Travel with Baby Made Easy,"I bought this as i was going from Idaho to London (18 hour journey and 3 flights each way) with just my son who is 10mths (please note he is preemie and so small 24"" at the time). I practiced at home before going on the plane as anyone with a small child on a plane will know there is not a lot of time or space to figure things out! Once you have the hang of it, it is simple to use (mind your finger nails though as the velcro straps are quite difficult to put through the plastic loops whilst hanging on to said child!) I got unbelievably lucky on the trip out, all my flights i had a spare seat next to me so that i could hammock the flyebaby round the back of the spare seat and my son, slept, giggled and ate in it on all three flights. On the way back was not so happy - not the fault of flyebaby, but i was on Delta flights and the seats are VERY close in front of you and there was not enough room to hammock my son on to me as his head was at a funny angle. If your child is small and so are you, and you have more leg room then you will have no problems at all.  Wonderful thing and worth every penny!",5,1
Infant Airplane Seat - Flyebaby Airplane Baby Comfort System - Air Travel with Baby Made Easy,Like some of the other reviews mention- the Flye Baby can be a little confusing when you first try to assemble it. We found that after sorting out the different straps it's pretty straight forward and it's easy each time. We have used it a handful of times now and it worked great on every flight except one where the distance between the seat in front of us was too small. When it work though it works and it makes the flight so much more enjoyable! The thing is so small and light it's not really a burden to bring even if there's a slight chance it won't work on a certain plane or tray table.,5,1

"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red","This stroller is perfect for a family on the go. Folds easily. comfy seat. great tray. rides over grass and pavement great.

Make sure you have an extra person with you when assembling  The stroller once completed pushes easy and smooth.It did not come with the cargo bags as described, I also though it was to have come with a storage bag but this was not included either.",5,1

All the parts and material is of good quality. It's a breeze to fold and unfold the stroller. It's extremely easy to carry with or without folded. My daughter (1.5 yrs) liked it and was pretty comfortable. We used it on airports, beaches, lawns and rough sidewalks and it performed great. The extra storage helps a lot and can easily carry a standard size diaper bags and some toys. It's a great deal for the price (50$).",5,1

"Swaddlebees One Size Simplex All In One Diapers, Owls","I love the idea of this diaper, but it's completely out of my price-range. I splurged on it with birthday money, and I'm sad to say I'm completely disappointed. Not only did a snap come off within the first two washes, but the rest of the snaps are pressed crooked and won't snap all the way. The diaper itself is great, but the craftmanship is completely sub-par for the price.",2,-1
"Swaddlebees Newborn Simplex All In One Diapers, Giraffe",Very cute print but I'm not that impressed with the diaper itself..

I am beyond disappointed - $50 down the hole.",1,-1
"GroVia My Choice Trainer, Cloud","My daughter finds this to be very uncomfortable, even at it's largest size setting, and she only weighs 20 lbs.  It makes indentations along her sides where the elastic sits.

Not worth the money, I prefer to use regular undies at home and pull-ups for travel.",1,-1
Giraffe Baby Pink Canvas Growth Chart,"I was so excited waiting to get this in the mail and when I receive it I was rather disappointed. Its NOT pink its a lilac purple.

My husband it pretty pissy that he paid $40 for it.",1,-1
Medela Breastmilk Storage Solution,"I love the set but had to go but it at the store for more because every time I tried ordering it from Amazon, the tray came broken.

"Skip Hop Wall Decals, Treetop Friends",I ordered these wall decals for my teenage daughter who loves giraffes. I'm very disappointed however that half of them have already fallen off the wall and had to be thrown away. More than half the ones that are still on the walls have tape holding them there. I would have thought for 25.00 this would have been a better product. I would not recommend these to anyone and feel a little like I was ripped off.,1,-1

"Skip Hop Wall Decals, Treetop Friends",I put these decals up last night and woke up this morning to half of them in the crib.  I cleaned my walls prior to adhering them and had other decals on the walls prior to these that stayed up for two years.  Very disappointed.,1,-1
"Skip Hop Wall Decals, Treetop Friends","As mentioned by other reviewers this sticker is super cute (4 stars) and a good value (4 stars) but it doesn't stay on the wall (1 star)! Skip Hop should make a better quality wall decal than this!!! I'd rather pay a few more bucks a get a sticker that actually sticks to the wall as advertised.I've had entire branches, leaves, etc. fall off the wall completely. That said, 60% of the pieces stay put, 20% have curling edges that creep back/peel slowly off the wall, and 20% fall off and are a daily frustration. I've tried supplementing with scotch tape on problem edges, and later a non-permanant double-sided (reposition-able tape). Results were mixed...it helps, but not enough. When I reapply and check the next day...it's on the floor again.Like others I am concerned about the choking hazard this presents as the product is designed to go in a nursery and could fall into the crib or on a changing table. Not sure what to do...if exchange it I have to take it everything down and then apply a new set that may not be any better in quality. This product has been more work and frustration than I bargained for...might have to go with boring bare walls.Some thoughts on what else exacerbates sticker adhesive problem: wall should be clean/dust-free, shouldn't be too cold, something other than a matte/eggshell paint (satin/semigloss gets better stick). I also noticed that the leaves positioned on the folds of the original backing are ones that tend to continue to curl on the edged and peel off the wall later.",2,-1

"Boon Catch Plate with Spill Catcher, Orange/Blue","This is a nice idea and it's cute, but so far I have not been able to get it to stick to anything for more than a few seconds. Kinda defeats the purpose when your grabby toddler can yank the whole thing right up and spill everything onto the table/floor.",2,-1
"Boon Catch Plate with Spill Catcher, Orange/Blue",I bought this especially for the suctIon cup bottom.  The suction releases very easily and my daughter dumps the plate.,2,-1

Munchkin 6 Piece Fork and Spoon Set,"This is not a good set if you want forks for your toddler.  The prongs are so close together, it is pretty much a spoon with holes in it.  For spoon self feeding they are ok but I would have been happier getting a better set had I known that it was pretty much a bunch of spoons.",2,-1
"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue",My mil bought this for our son. At first I thought it wasn't working because of the bubbles I used. I went and bought another type and it still did not work. Didn't even blow out the mouth.,1,-1

"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue",Do not waste your money. The bubbles pop before they leave the wand. My kids were so disappointed with this toy.,1,-1
"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue",I didn't buy this from Amazon but it is so bad that I had to write a review anyway.  It really does not work it just click sand when it does spin one or two bubbles come out.  Not worth the money I spent.,1,-1
"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue","Received as a gift and cannot return, because otherwise I would.Problem 1 it is to heavy to hold up with the suction cup and falls into water.Problem 2 when it falls in, the water mixes with solution and creates a slippery bath tub(to much soap in bath water)Problem 3 doesn't blow but a few bubbles wastes a lot of baby bath-your better off saving a bubble wand and blowing some yourself",1,-1
"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue","My child got this as a present. Never got it to work. The reviewer who suggested covering part of the mouth is worth a try (will try tonight) but as paying customers, we should not have to resort to ghetto home-fix like this -- it should have worked right out of the box! Even when barely used, the power switch (on top of the head) is failing already. Yesterday, I was trying a different bubble solution (did not work, no surprise) and could not turn it off (the power button would not pop back up). After 10 minutes of trying pushing it here and there along the edges, it finally turned off (phew) but I was this &lt;--> close to prying the battery compartment open and throwing it in the trash. The only thing that stopped me is my child likes the penguin shape (despite no bubbles). This is a piece of junk. Save your money and buy a different bubble blower.",1,-1
"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue","The tip about taping half the air output port works somewhat, but that's no excuse for this thing being really poor to begin with. Additional problems include a *screwed-in* battery compartment, incredible noisiness, and very high likelihood that your child will get his finger pinched/mangled when they inevitably shove their hand into the cute penguin's rotating death mouth.",2,-1
"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue","As another reviewer said, it works great when you put tape over the left half of the air valve.  2 stars because you shouldn't have to put tape over it.  So if you're like me, and you didn't even test it out before you could return it, tape is your best option.",2,-1
"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue","was excited to get, but bubbles ont come out b/c the machine blows too hard. I dont think you should have to ""rig"" a product to have it work properly, the one star is for how cute the apperance is. buy a different product.",1,-1
"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue","So.....why is this flawed, non-working product still on the market? Munchkin has some really good items, and some crap....this...falling into the latter category.  Strange that  they haven't done a complete redesign with all of the product returns. Mine is definitely going back. I don't give my son disappointing, crappy, non-working toys.It's a bubble blower. I doesn't blow bubbles, I don't even care what the reason is....fact is it doesn't do the one thing it is marketed for....or anything else, for that matter.",1,-1
"Munchkin SpongeBob SquarePants Click Lock Insulated Straw Cup, Colors May Vary, 9 Ounce","We have used many Munchkin straw cups, but for some reason these are awful.

Very disappointed in Munchkin.",1,-1

"Munchkin Precision Fit 24&quot; Gate, White","You get what you pay for... I bought two of these to block my toddler from going into the kitchen & from accessing the hallway to the bedrooms. One of these broke the first day, the second one broke within three weeks. The compacted wood cracked once I tightened the arms, but I couldn't go a latch less because it wouldn't fit the entire doorway without being loose.The white clamps that are supposed to keep the levers & gate doors in place, bend very easily. ALL of them bent. They aren't strong enough to hold the arms in place nor the gate doors straight.Also, my one year old was able to lift the lever and get past the gate, thus defeating the entire purpose of me purchasing these gates. I know a lot of people get these gates for their dogs, which MIGHT have worked fine, if my 11 pound dog poodle mix wasn't able to chew through the plastic as well.These gates don't really do a good job at anything. I used to own one three years ago, which is why I bought two the minute my first one broke. I have to be honest in saying that the craftsmanship and quality have definitely gone down within the past 3 years. I would recommend to splurge for the $24 dollar gates, or the $50. It's what I'm going to end up paying for, since I need to buy two more that aren't cheaply crafted.",1,-1
"Munchkin Precision Fit 24&quot; Gate, White","If you are going to install it and there is no chance anyone is going to move it, step over it, breath on it or look at it then you will love it. If this is not the case, then do not waste your money. It WILL fall apart within days.",2,-1
"Munchkin Precision Fit 24&quot; Gate, White",dont buy it! it not like the old school gates that look like this. It very cheaply made and messes up all the time. The plastic tabs on it always gets caught into the gate,1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",We bought this 2 days ago after purchasing the Homemedics Soundspa projector. It stopped working after about a month of use and after reading the reviews I thought we would give this one a try.This is our 2nd day to use it and when I turned it on this evening while putting our little one to bed the projector was on but not rotating. It took me a couple minutes of working on it to get it started and even then it is sketchy on the movement!i don't understand why these projectors dont last!,2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I have ordered two of these sound systems now.  My little one loved watching her friends dancing around on the ceiling.  After having it for two months, the projector quit working.  I bought another one finally in December and now, three months later, the projector quit again.  I love this machine when it works, but it doesn't last long.",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Fine when it works, which is for about 2 months.  I have gone through three of them, too bad they aren't more long lasting.  The sounds are pretty good, the nightlight is useful, and the projector works well mostly (hard to keep focused well).  But the killer issue is that it just stops working after 1-2 months.",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",I would have given this product 10 stars (if available) if it was not for projector that stopped working after month of use. I was really dissaponted as my 9 month old got used to sound and projector and would look at it during night when he wakes up and would fall back asleep. Not fun to have baby get used to something and then it stops working!,2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",This sound machine is nice but it broke with in two weeks of use. I will be returning it to try a different model.,1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I bought this product less than 2 weeks ago and it is already making a horrible grinding noise when the projector is on. I'm very disappointed because that's what I loved about this projector compared to another brand - the silence! The first one I got over a year ago lasted a long time before the projector quit turning (it still didn't make any noise). I'm on the fence whether or not I want to to risk getting another dud or just go back to the other brand whose projector makes whirring noise as well but the picture is clearer. Overall, the music is great, I just wish this particular projector had lasted longer than 2 weeks! Now I have to buy another one which means $25 down the drain.",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",Don't bother Buying this. I should have listened to the bad reviews. It broke within just a few weeks. DO NOT BUY spend the extra 10/20 dollars and buy something that will actually work,1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","This sound machine has lovely white noise that my baby needs to sleep, and beautiful turning light pictures projected on the ceiling. So after 2 months when the motor burned out and stopped moving the projection, we immediately purchased another one (the first was a gift off amazon, the second was from babies r us). And then, within 2 weeks, the SAME THING HAPPENED. We only even ran the projections at night. After reading up about these machines, this seems to be a common problem. Very disappointed",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","The sound on the system no longer works after 4 months of normal use. In 2012, we purchased the Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine - it's still working after almost two years of use.  Avoid the Munchkin and pay the extra $10 for the Graco.",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","It worked great and my daughter loved it until the projector stopped spinning. We sent it back and received a new one, it only took another month for the new one to stop working. It would be five stars without this problem.",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Within a week of our first order, the sound machine volume stopped working so that it was very, very quiet. We returned it for a replacement. The second machine's projector stopped spinning within a matter of weeks. We loved this machine when it worked. We're so disappointed that this product wasn't made to last.",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I was so excited to get this item, especially after such wonderful reviews. It's a good idea in theory, but no matter what sound you play it sounds like the volume is always tuned up too high with a loud muffled static sound on everything. Unfortunately, I could not get past the poor sound and had to send it back.",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Like other posters have mentioned, the projector stopped working. For us, it was after 2 months of almost nightly use.Prior to that, we were only marginally happy with the Munchkin Nursery Projector. The sounds are low-quality, extremely short clips; the white noise clip is short enough that it creates an obvious beat pattern (and thus fails to really be white noise).The one cool thing is that the projector has a auto-on mode where it will come on when it detects a baby's cry. It really works and hadn't ever turned on to a noise other than our daughter's crying. That earned this an extra star.Lastly, despite being in Amazon's 90 return window, Amazon will not accept a return because, ""this is a known issue"" and we're supposed to contact the manufacturer. A known issue and you still sell it and won't take it back? That's not cool... especially when the manufacturer's customer service seems to be slow in replying to email inquiries. I guess a phone call will be required.",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",I love the images this product projects and the fact that the music continually plays all night.  It helped my 2 1/2 year old sleep alone in her room all night.BUT...After about a month the motor turning the projection images started to get loud and after about 4 months the motor stopped turning the image.  I ended up replacing it with a comparable items from my local department store and I hope this one lasts longer.,1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Who's got the button? Which button? This button or that one? Too many darn buttons!!! The projection is poor no matter how you turn it around, the volume is more than ample, the auto turn on isn't a good idea and the sounds are fairly annoying. Not horrible. Not something I'd get again.",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Loved the idea of this projector. My 7 month old was waking up 2-3 time a night, after reading all the reviews I couldn't wait to get this in the mail. It lived up to my exceptions UNTIL the pictures that were projected on the ceiling stopped moving. I figured it was just a defect with this one so I sent it back and ordered another. 2 weeks after I got the new one in the mail it did the same thing. We only used the projector at night and had it set to 30 min, + voice activation was on. There is NO WAY it was used enough to wear out the spinner. Great idea but VERY POOR QUALITY!!! Super sad that this didn't work for us. Am now looking for a new one to take its place!",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Our little guy is colicky, which is a bummer, but he loves his white noise. So, I was happy with this product the first week, until it started skipping. We sent it back (which was very convenient thru amazon). We just received our replacement today and it is already skipping and turning itself on when it is set on off. How annoying! So, we have to send this one back as well. Meanwhile, another sleepless nite without a white noise machine:(",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",I got one for my baby shower as a gift and it worked perfect for 1 week. So I purchased a 2nd one for my ranch house. It also lasted about two weeks. However neither one lasted more than a month. The projector broke first and now neither machine will make noise.,1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","We have owned three of these. One's projector stopped turning after about three months of use. The one that we bought to replace that one has already stopped working and makes a terrible noise so we are unable to use the projector, just the white noise feature. The third one is in our youngest child's nursery..... we don't use the projector as often in her room and it still works fine. It's a great product, it just doesn't last.",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",I loved it at first but then the lights quit rotating so the image stays on the same thing. Disappointing and doesnt keep my daughter distracted because the light doesnt play. The music and night light work fine though,2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",This item was one of the top results when i searched for baby cds player. This product does not play cds.,1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","It worked great and my baby enjoyed it a lot. Then after 6 1/2 weeks, the projector stopped rotating. I was able to exchange it at the store I got it from, but I'm quite disappointed that it didn't last long before it stopped working properly. We'll see how long the new one last for. I'll give it a second chance, but if it breaks on us again, I'll look for another brand.UPDATE: (June 10, 2014) 4 weeks later, and the projector stopped rotating again! What a piece of junk! Won't bother exchanging for a 3rd one. I'll just look for another brand!",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","My son was given this as a gift when he was two months old. He slept in a bassinet then pack and play in our bedroom his first nine months due to breathing problems. Because if this the unit was only used sporadically for the first seven months we had it.  When my son finally started sleeping in his crib I would turn on the white noise and projector. The white noise was kept on all night but I turned off the projector after an hour or so. After a couple of months the projector lights up but no longer rotates. My son, who is now almost 15 months old asks for the projector every night. I've decided instead of buying a new one (that will probably stop working after a few shirt months) I'm getting some glow in the dark stars and creating a mobile to hang from the ceiling....",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","This is my 4th sound/projector machine and they are all junk. Usually the projector is the first to go, on this one it was the sound. They are all junk and I have a graveyard of broken sound/projector machines. This one looked better than the other ones out there but it broke after only a few uses. Save your money and buy a better quality white noise machine and get a nightlight.",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Updated January 3, 2014.  I received a new one of these and this one won't stay shut off.  Turns on and runs great, but when you turn off the sound and projection, they come back on within 10 seconds on their own.  So, I sent it back to Amazon (Thank you, Amazon for the amazingly quick turn around with a replacement!).  The replacement arrived today and same thing.  Turns itself back on after 10 seconds even if it shuts itself off with the timer.New Review: I've purchased 3 or 4 of these because my son loves the jungle projection on it.  The projection is always the first to crap out.  I just received a new one today and guess what?  This one won't turn off.  I got it all set up and turned it on.  Got it positioned and went to turn it off.  Turned off and then 5 seconds later it came back on all by itself.  Now the only way to get it stay off is to unplug it, which means that I have to reset the sound each time.  Seriously?  These projection sounds machines (the Munchkin one and and the SoundSpa one) are junk.  JUNK.  Save your money.  Don't purchase them!Original Review: Got this a few months ago and loved it. However, it has started shorting out. If you turn on the noise and then the projection, the whole thing turns off. And then when you can get it on, the projection doesn't turn. Grr.",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","But unfortunately for me, I wanted it for the nightlight and music, and I could care less about the projection because I feel like it keeps him up longer and actually keeps him from going to sleep instead of lulling him to sleep.The nightlight is useless for peeking in on him (the main thing I wanted it for!) because it's a faint blue glow pointed upward and you can't see a thing below it (which is where the baby is, in his bed). So unless you have this thing the same height as the baby, you're not going to be able to see him/her.  Ironically, it's too bright to leave on all night as a nightlight because it lights up the top half of the whole room way too much.  It's a weird light, a blue glow that lights up the room but makes it hard to see any specific thing.  Like moonlight sort of.The music is okay but it just plays part of a little tune over and over, which has to be annoying even for a baby.  This thing is going to the Salvation Army, and I'm just going to get a regular night light (in a color other than blue) and a small CD player so I can play a lullaby CD that will play entire songs.It might be great if you're looking for ambient light and projection, but if you're looking for ""checking in"" light and music, I'd look elsewhere.",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I really loved this product, but unfortunately the quality isn't very good.  The first time we bought this, the projector stopped working within a few months.  We would push the button to turn the projector on and the whole thing would shut off.  We contacted Amazon about the issue and they sent us a replacement.  We received the replacement and within a month and a half, the projector stopped rotating.  Had I reviewed this product initially, I would have given it 5 stars, however, after going through two that have broken down within a couple months of use, I have to rate this one at a 2.",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","My daughter has absolutely loved this product. However, 16 days AFTER warranty ended the projector as well as the night light  completely stopped working. Because of that, and returning the item for replacement not being an option, I would not recommend this product.",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","For the first 2.5 months, we loved this thing.  The sound is loud enough to have an effect on a newborn and the projector is nice and bright (it reaches the cathedral ceiling in the bedroom and still looks great).  No problems with the blue button like others mention.  I guess if it's that big of a deal, we'd just put a strip of electrical tape over it or something.  Maybe if we weren't using the projector it would be more noticeable.Anyway, as dozen of other folks have stated on here, the rotating part of the projector stopped working a few days ago.Munchkin states that there is a one year limited warranty, so I just contacted them about replacing it.  Either way, I'll come back and update my review with the results.Update (20 Oct 2013):I got a replacement unit pretty quickly from Munchkin.  I thought that maybe we were abusing the product by leaving the projector on too long, so we used the 45-minute timer this time.  It didn't help--the replacement unit didn't last three months.I just contacted Munchkin again and got a mixed response that I hope I'm misinterpreting.  I was told they would replace the projector just one more time.  They also stated that the product has been redesigned, presumably, in part, to fix this defect.  I reminded them that I expect them to honor the full term of their warranty and I hope that's the end of that.So--now I'm waiting for my second and, hopefully, final replacement.I've been very happy with Munchkin's responsiveness.  I've been working with a woman named Amanda who has done a great job taking care of me--I just wish their product quality was a bit better.",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",Poor picture quality.  Lack of variety of music  Did not like the product  Chose something that would play more tunes,1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I chose this product bc baby sleeps with loud white noise (we have the hammacher schlemmer brand) and it has a loud volume option for white noise. At first I was so excited to use it. After 3 nights of leaving it on all night long on the loudest white noise setting, it crapped out.  It would only play the white noise at a &#34;whisper&#34; level. I breathe louder than it played. Since that was the main feature I needed, its now sitting in a box.",1,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I loved the features on this machine for the price.  However, 2 weeks of use later, and the motor that rotated the projector died so it doesn't rotate the pictures anymore.  I loved the 3 discs of patterns, and my 3 month old was totally fascinated with them.  It was the perfect nursing light.  The sounds are also good and not nearly as annoying as some baby soothers.  The voice activation feature is a really cool idea, but my baby doesn't cry loudly enough to trigger it.  The only sound that has triggered it thus far is my 3 dogs barking.  By the way, I did not drop the machine or damage it.  It simply stopped working and it was too late to return it.  If everything worked, it would be 5 stars!",2,-1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",At first this was a good purchase I felt but as I continued to use this product (only a few months old) the sound becomes more and more muffled.  You can't really hear any of the sounds at all.  In order to get that muffled sound out you have to turn down the volume very low to where you can't really hear anything.  I am very upset with this product.  I really was hoping that it would work better.,1,-1

"Munchkin Wide Spaces Expanding Gate, Light Wood","I loved this gate for about the first 6 months of using it.  After that...the honeymoon was over.  Yes, it fit our wide doorway spanning the living room into the kitchen so I didn't have to worry about little hands &#34;helping&#34; with dinner preparations, but that is about it.  After about 6 months the top plastic pieces started separating in the middle so if I walked through it and then turned around to close it I would have to fiddle with the damned pieces to make them fit properly so I could lock the door.  THEN, the plastic hinges started cracking.  At that point we tried to be as gentle as we could with the gate because we had invested $50 in it and really didn't want to go out and buy another gate, uninstall the current P.O.S. then re-install another gate that would leave more holes in our woodwork.  Being &#34;gentle&#34; (let's face it...we have 3 kids, 2 cats and a dog...gentle is relative) bought us about another 6 months...now one hinge is completely busted, the top plastic pieces are hopeless and we are removing the gate and trashing it after only a year.  We have another gate we bought 2 years ago at this point, have moved it to 2 different locations in the house and it is STILL going strong.  My advice...look for a gate that has METAL hinges and no plastic what so ever...unless you are only looking to get through a minimum amount of time...then by all means get this.",1,-1
"Munchkin Wide Spaces Expanding Gate, Light Wood",One end of it snapped the first week we had it installed. My husband glued and tied it back together with clamps. But it's not strong.  The closing mechanism is also a pain. It takes both hands and is still tricky.,1,-1
"Munchkin Wide Spaces Expanding Gate, Light Wood","First, I want to warn all readers that the many positive reviews on this gate are fake, and placed here by people who are paid by the company to pump up their rating.The gate is just OK, but installation is difficult.Also, buy and use your own screws!  BETTER YET, DO NOT BUY THIS GATE!This is very important. The screws they supply with the gate are of the poorest quality one can find in China. Very poor. During installation ALL  the screws were stripped and two snapped in the wood! I hate to drill and tear my wall apart to remove the broken screw.A job that should have been simple turned into a nightmare all because the screws were bad. I can't begin to explain how much anger I have for this company.DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT LET THEM WASTE YOUR TIME!",1,-1

"Munchkin Bubble Spout Guard, Blue",I bought this spout cover after reading reviews. I needed one that would allow me to pull the switch for the shower up. This cover does that but is way too big for my spout. The elephant is completely open on the bottom and is supposed to attach with a dinky piece of Velcro. My 9 month old son immediately reached for it and pulled it right off. It can't protect his head if it won't stay on. Complete waste of money.,1,-1
"Munchkin Scoop Drain and Store Bath Toy Organizer, Blue","I was very skeptical about any kind of product that used tape strips to stick to a wall in a very humid room...but this had good reviews so I tried it.  It's a joke.  Cleaned the wall, attached the sticky base and held firmly for about 3 minutes, then let sit for 24 hours until I hung the scoop on it.  That night I am sleeping and hear this huge crash in the bathroom...yup it fell off.  And it was not packed heavily, just those little rubber animals. Part of me knew there was no way these sticky strips would hold up, but I am still mad over this purchase and want to return it for a refund.",1,-1

"Munchkin Quick Install 26&quot; Gate, Black","Amazon stirred me wrong on this one.  It hardly deserves one star!  This gate completely fell apart on me and it hardly grasped on when it did work.  The little pieces that hold the gate in-line started coming off one by one.  The scary part is that it came off and the screw was sticking through which is a huge safety hazard.  I maybe moved the gate off and on 6 times before it started falling apart.  The baby isn't even big enough to start tugging on it or messing with it, so I can't imagine it lasting one day with a baby that has more stability.  This thing is CRAP CRAP CRAP!!!!!",1,-1

"Munchkin Time Saver Bottle Warmer, White","Nothing too exciting about this product. The water reservoir leaks all over with any sort of movement of the warmer.

"Munchkin Time Saver Bottle Warmer, White","My daughter is 10 weeks old.  I bought this turn dial model just a few weeks ago.  My daughter is mainly breastfed and gets an occasional bottle if I'm not home so this bottle warmer has only been used maybe 12 times.  The dial NO LONGER WORKS!  If its turned past 2 minutes it will continue to heat until the water runs out, which can seriously boil the milk.  I'm really disappointed considering we have hardly used it.  I will be contacting the manufacturer to get a refund.  It worked great the first few times, so we threw the recpt away.  My cousin has the digital version and has used it with two kids so maybe that model works better??",1,-1

"Munchkin Time Saver Bottle Warmer, White","I bought this bottle warmer at Target because it was cheap, bad mistake. I'll now be spending more money to buy a different one.The hole for the resesior is on the bottom so it's hard to fill it up then tip it upside down and click into the main unit without spilling water everywhere. It doesn't hold a lot of water and runs out everyday if you are using it often. If its empty you'll know by the smell of burning plastic as the bottom of your bottle melts.I never did figure out the proper length of time to heat the bottles to get the right temp. The outside of the bottle comes out scalding hot so much so I was afraid it would burn my LO's lips but yet the contents were still cold.You defintely get what you pay for here. I'm switching to the dr brown warmer. It's easier to fill, the resesior last longer and most of all it heats bottles to the right temp. It also has an electronic display to set the heating time, with memory, so it's only one button to use and gives you more flexibility when trying to figure out the perfect length of time for your bottle.",1,-1

"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","Having the Medela pump and a ton of bottles from the storage solution that I already cleaned, I wanted to love this nipple. But my 5-week old hates it. While the design and concept is intelligent, it just doesn't work for babies with a strong suck. The milk would overflow into the nipple and make my newborn gag or wear more milk than what was consumed (doesn't make for a happy momma when breastmilk goes to waste). At first I was worried I had a stubborn baby that just wasn't going to accept a bottle, but then I tried the Tommee TIppee Closer to Nature and so far the slow flow nipple is a success. But I'm left with about a dozen Medela bottles. You live and you learn as you're taught by your baby I suppose!",2,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce",The lactation consultant suggested we purchase this bottle to make the transition between nursing and bottle feeding easier...but the baby absolutely dislikes this bottle and will not eat from it.,1,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","I purchased this bottle set from Babies R Us a few days ago. My son is exclusively breastfed, but needed something while I am on a heavy dose of antibiotics for the next week. I bought this bottle set thinking that the baby controlled flow would be more conducive to what he was used to. This bottle has been nothing but a means of frustration for my son. Granted, he isn't used to bottles, so perhaps a baby who is used to bottles all the time will have a different outcome, but this is NOT the next best thing to breast. He took a tommee tippee better than this, (though still not as easy as breastfeeding) as well as an evenflow regular nipple. It was SUCH A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY for my needs. I am so disappointed in this product because I was really trying to make the transition as easy as possible for the next week, so that by weeks end he wouldn't have so much nipple confusion. I will keep on with the tommee tippee and hopefully things will be a little less stressful. I really don't recommend this bottle for someone else in the same situation who wants to keep the nipple confusion to a minimum.",2,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","Up front, I'd like to say that my 2 stars are based on a latch and suck issue with my son.  If your child does not have latch and suck issues, this review is not for you...My son was born with very little suck reflex, so I was forced to pump and use a syringe to feed him.  As his suck developed, he was moved to a bottle.  We tried moving him to the breast, but his suck was never sufficient to pull the milk down.  I was really hoping this bottle would either leave the door open to moving him to the breast later or at least help him strengthen his suck so that he could feed better and have less air from swallowing from a regular bottle/nipple.I'm assuming this bottle must be really awesome at feeling more like breastfeeding to the baby because my son was just not able to get milk out of it well enough to not feel frustrated.  I tried it again recently since he is now almost 7 months.  He was still not able to use this bottle :-(  So, if your child has any type of suck issue that is forcing you to bottle feed, you may want to steer clear of this one.",2,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","I did want to like these bottles because I had heard good things about them at a prenatal breastfeeding class, as it is supposed to mimic breastfeeding (baby has to work to get the milk out) and the human nipple, reducing nipple confusion. The main gripe I have about these is that it does not work as it is supposed too - the flow is still too fast and my baby ends up choking! It's highly disappointing, especially given the premium price of this product. I could get 3 bottles of other brands like Dr Brown's, PLaytex etc for that price. I bought a few of these bottles before realizing that these would not work for my baby.",2,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce",At first she screamed thinking it was a paci. Then she sucked so hard the milk spurred all over. It's a cruel joke,1,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","This bottle was way too fast for our baby. Even when sitting him upright and holding the bottle level, it's like the milk just pours into his mouth.  We're very disappointed, especially considering the ridiculous price",1,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","Like others, we really wanted to like this product.  Our daughter has difficulty with bottles because of the fast flow of the milk.  We purchased the Calma because its advertising indicates that &#34;your baby controls the flow of the milk&#34; and because &#34;Calma helps avoid gassiness.&#34;While it's true that with Calma the baby initiates the flow of the milk, in our experience, once the milk flow is established you've opened a flood gate.  Feeding our daughter with this was like stuffing a fire-hose down her throat.  Milk gushed out of her mouth, and every time she would try to stop and breathe, she would gag on the milk.  This is all despite the instructions saying &#34;your baby has time to breathe.&#34;The worst part was when our daughter's gag turned into a full choke and she stopped breathing until we were able to get her on her stomach and drain the liquid out of her.I find it amusing that the instructions say &#34;[t]his is different than with any other nipple - you may need a bit of patience and persistence.&#34;  Sorry, I'm happy to persist in most new endeavors, but my patience doesn't include choking my infant.Horrible product.",1,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","The Medela Calma works but not that well. It does make the baby create a vacuum like when on the breast; however, the flow of milk is VERY fast. The baby can gulp down 3 oz in no time, making him gassy. I wouldn't buy it again, too pricey with poor results.",2,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","My son is exclusively breastfed. We tried two other bottles that he either refuses or the flow is too fast. Calma seemed to be the answer when I read the advertisement, however, it was worse than the other bottles. The nipple is way too hard for starters...also the nipple is long & my son nearly gagged whenever it was in his mouth then when he tried to suck for 2 seconds nothing came out and it made him even more frustrated. Were hoping to find another bottle soon before he goes to daycare.",1,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","This bottle is not supposed to leak milk when you turn it upside down, but mine does.  When my son sucks, more milk comes out than when he's eating from a regular bottle.  Save your money.",2,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","I used a variety of Medela products for my first son, who I wasn't able to breastfeed directly. I pumped for him for 8-9 months, and I was always happy with their products - I had an assortment of pumps and bottles, replacement parts, and cleaning supplies.When my second son was born last month, it was important for me that I succeed in breastfeeding directly, so I was excited to try the Calma system despite the much greater cost. However after several tries, a few cons became clear - first of all, although the baby does have to suck to get the milk out, the flow was still too fast for my son and made him spit up. Secondly, the nipple seemed to be too long, and made him gag. Lastly, since the nipple is designed to keep milk from leaking out, it is impossible to shake out those few drops you need to test the temperature of the milk on your wrist.After several attempts with the Calma system, I concluded that I would have preferred to have stuck with regular slow-flow nipples from the get-go. I've started to use them instead after seeing the problems with the Calma nipple, they haven't affected his ability to breastfeed, and bottle-feeding has been easier when I've had to do it. I regret having spent the extra money for the Calma.",2,-1
"Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Set, 5 Ounce","The flow was way too fast, and it did not seem like my baby controlled the flow at all. it poured down his face and he seemed to choke on the milk every time he took a drink. for the price you would expect the product to work much better, and I will not be using the calma with my child.",1,-1
Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Nipple,"We can visibly see the air going through the tunnel of the nipple. Our baby was very gassy from using this, even our pediatrician scolded us for using this when we fed the baby in the office. And the nipple material is much stiffer than all the other brands. Baby was much better after we switched.",1,-1
Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Nipple,"I wanted to get this nipple as my infant seems to choke on milk with the regular nipple as it continues to flow without her providing suction.  This nipple attempts to solve that by not free flowing milk, which it does a good job of.  Unfortunately, when the suction is applied and the milk flows, the flow rate is too high and she still chokes and coughs on the milk.  This was a great idea if only they could slow down the flow.  This nipple ended up being a waste of money, but was worth a try.  At an older age, she may be able to better tolerate the flow.",1,-1
Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Nipple,"It was a lot of parts, and made a mess as my son ate. The wide slow flow nipples are easier to use and clean.",2,-1
Medela Calma Breastmilk Feeding Nipple,"I purchased this just as it was becoming available and there wasn't reviews to read.  I was eager to purchase a nipple that would best fit baby's nursing pattern, that would also fit on the medela bottles.  I liked the idea that once I pumped (such in the car while traveling) that I could feed baby once we arrived to our destination.  That is specifically why I purchased it.  For $20 (inc. tax), I was expecting a nipple that would (1) fit, and (2) feed at baby's pace.  It does fit.  But WHOA does it feed my baby FAST!!  My 2 mo. had his bottle gone within minutes.  Normally we use Playtex bottles and that takes around 10+ minutes.  Nursing sessions take about 20+ minutes.Giving the bottle with the Calma felt odd at first with the elongated teat.  I had to squeeze the bottle to teach him that milk could come out.  But! Don't squeeze too hard or it's like a ketchup bottle!! :)Bottom line, my baby was able to use this nipple.  But as a mom, I do not feel comfortable with the fast flow rate that he received his milk.  I'm a gadget girl, and I really liked the idea behind this.  But it's not a good fit for us.  Twenty bucks wasted.",1,-1

Nuk Straw Active Cup Spill-proof 10oz. BPA Free 12m+ Boys Color,"I bought this one about 3 months ago. My son (2 years old) likes this colorful bottle, but when he drinks water (about 2 times daily in his day care), he also bites on the straw. After he used it for 3-4 days, I started to see a crack on the straw. The crack gets so big after about 1 month. I had to cut the top part of straw, starting from crack spot. I have already cut the straw 2 times. The straw is now quite short for him to suck the water out. I am looking for the replacement straw. If I cannot find it, I have to throw this bottle away.The bottle might work for a little older kids who do not bite on the straw, but it does not work for my toddler son.",1,-1

"Perry Mackin Zoey Diaper Tote, Brown","When I splurged on this bag, I loved it... For the first few months. It has been a year and the bag has not held up well at all. It is no longer usable. The zipper on the cosmetic bag broke in short order and the stitching where the handles attach to the bag has come completely apart from the fabric, causing the bag to look like a shapeless sack. The leather on the edges of the hand straps has started to peel. Using the shoulder strap regularly causes the corners to turn up and the middle to sink permanantly in if you're carrying milk or a bottle of water around, so you lose the nice square shape fairly quickly. If you're a working mom and this is a bag you intend to carry only on the weekend or on evenings out with the baby, it may hold up for you. If you're using this diaper bag all day every day with your child, pick something else. It deteriorated much more quickly than it should have.",2,-1

"Boppy Travel Pillow, Mama Dot/Basket Green","We have a Boppy pillow at home that I like very much. When the baby was little, I spent the day trading-off between the Boppy and the My Breast Friend pillow. When it was time for our first plane trip, I ordered this one and and inflatable My Breast Friend pillow. There is no question in my mind that the inflatable My Breast Friend pillow is the clear winner for airplane travel. The Boppy travel pillow is just too large and cumbersome.I have flown six times across the country during the first 7.5 months of baby's life. On five of those flights, I flew without my SO. This meant I would gate check the stroller (I found the Uppababy Cruz  works best - it has a giant basket) and then have to carry the baby (in the baby bjorn) and all of our bags (diaper bag, large purse with computer, breast pump) to our seat. This pillow would have been impossible. It is huge and would have been one additional giant thing to lug around. I would recommend that you do yourself a favor and get the inflatable My Breast Friend.",2,-1

"Babymel BM901 Cross Body,Navy Stripe,One Size","This really is a very stylish bag. I had high hopes because it's a good size but doesn't scream ""MOM"" like a conventional diaper bag.However, this bag could not have possibly been designed by a mom. It has two main pockets, both of which are the full depth of the bag, 18.5 inches deep. You basically have to stack items on top of each other to fit everything. I don't mind that so much as long as I have smaller pockets for smaller items like gas drops, or baby Tylenol. There are two pockets (only two) inside the main body of the bag but they go all the way to the bottom, again, 18.5 inches. Anything I put in them is instantly lost. To fully utilize the pocket, I just have to stack things on top of each other which makes for a rough few minutes of digging while my baby is impatiently waiting (screaming). It just doesn't make sense. Why not four stacked pockets instead of two long ones? Why not extra pockets or pouches in the other large compartment?Kudos for the built in insulated bottle pouch on the outside of the bag and I do love love love the outer fabric and print. Really chic and casual looking in navy or red. It also has a great overall shape. Like a messenger bag with a twist. I also liked that it had two main but separate sides of the body.But why no cute lining? Would it have been so impossibly hard to put a bright blue, green, or pink lining instead of boring mom beige?? The lining was not a deal breaker, though, as I'm sure some moms prefer the simplicity of beige.Long story short, I really wanted this bag to work. Had the organization been more realistic for a mom carrying small things for their small person, I'm sure it would have. But struggling to find my car keys, or the paci in it was just a nightmare. I had to return it. :o(",2,-1

Blooming Bath Baby Bath - Hot Pink,"I received a gift card to a high-end baby store.  This was one of the least expensive items in the store (at $40).  I thought it was adorable, albeit, impractical.  However, I had the gift card so I bought it.  My daughter is 2 months old and we've been using it 1-2 times a week since she came home from the hospital.  We've put it through the wash twice.I'll start with the pros.  This bath is adorable and your baby will be even more adorable in it when you take pictures.  It is super soft.  I've got 2 other girls who I bathed the old-fashioned way when they were newborns (holding over the kitchen sink, trying not to let them literally slip out of my hands).  This bath allows me to set the baby in the petals and wash her without feeling like I'm going to drop her.  For the first time (in baby bathing history at our house), the baby doesn't scream through bath time.  It is a very relaxing experience compared to my other children.  It is a very snug fit in the sink, but I like it because it allows the baby to sit up more.  Some reviewers didn't care for the fit in the sink, but I don't mind.Now, for the cons...the bath is expensive and poorly made, in my opinion.  We've only used the bath a maximum of 16 times (I really don't think we've even used it that much)and the seam that connects the center to the petals has already split quite significantly.  Also, it is difficult to wring out (even if you follow the directions of pressing all the petals to the center) and therefore, quite heavy (which probably contributed to the split seam).While I love bath time with this, I wish it was a higher quality product.  Maybe then it would be worth the $40+ price tag.  As it is, I can't recommend something this expensive that has not kept it's stitching.",2,-1

"KidCo Safeway Safety Gate, White","Total Garbage!  The latch opens easily.  My 11 month old child was able to open the gate the very first time she encountered it.  I suppose if you only need the gate as a visual barrier, like for unmotivated pets, it would be sufficient.  For a child with any level of intelligence beyond vegetable, it will not contain them.  In addition, the installation instructions are terrible, not a single picture.",1,-1
"KidCo Safeway Safety Gate, White","I bought this gate because it seemed like the best/safest gate out there. However, it is just an inch short of my stairway space! And there is only one extension available: 24 inches!!!! Plus it is roughly the same price as the gate! They need to offer a smaller, cheaper extension. Also, my husband has been having a really hard time installing the gate. He starting day 4 of installation today. I hope he succeeds...",2,-1
"KidCo Safeway Safety Gate, White","I have similar gate from several years ago (not sure on the exact year). The old version has metal hinges and a metal locking mechanism. This new gate has plastic hinges and a plastic locking mechanism. The plastic hinges are an improvement from the previous design. However, the locking mechanism is lacking in my opinion. It simply won't keep the gate secured in place. My 2 year old can easily pull back on the gate and pop it out of the clasp. It appears that the plastic will deform slightly, which is enough to allow the gate to open. It seems to be the victim of cost cutting measures. Luckily, this new gate is used as a pet gate and I use the old one for the child gate. It is unfortunate. I like the look, but I was lead to believe this was a safety gate. i don't find it anywhere near as secure as the older version.",2,-1
"KidCo Safeway Safety Gate, White","When we first put up the gate we were happy with it because it wouldn't move at all (front to back, side to side), but we quickly noticed that if you lift upwards without pushing the button in with enough pressure it still opens.  it doesn't really take that much pressure for it to happen either.We are putting this at the top of stairs so we were expecting a much more child proof latch that would be virtually impossible for the child to open.  That is not the case with this gate.  I assume they were trying to keep it where it could be opened with one hand vs two, but I would take a two hand operation at the top of my stairs if it meant zero chance the child could open it.",1,-1
"KidCo Safeway Safety Gate, White","Decent value - but it is nowhere near as easy to install as it claims to be. I am pretty handy, and it took me at least a couple hours. Plus, even with using their template provided, not everything lines up as perfect as they make it seem like it should. The top can be pulled all the way out if someone tried which makes me nervous.Also it's worth mentioning that I had multiple screws break the heads right off in my oak wood stair banister. I pre-drilled starter holes as instructed, and as I knew needed to be done, but the heads just snapped right off. I had to re-drill a few holes which certainly didn't help with the alignment issues I was already having, and I know my banister will look like crap once I'm ready to remove this gate in a couple years.Between the alignment problems, cheap quality screws, being able to pull the top hinge right out, and the fact that the &#34;locking&#34; mechanism isn't all that great - I am very disappointed in a product that was supposed to be easy to install and ensure the safety of my children. Wish I would have paid an extra $10 or $20 to get something better.",2,-1

One Step Ahead Family Travel Organizer,Where do all these good reviews are coming from?I bought this all excited it ...and here it is... Standing in the corner of my basement gathering dust.It is super uncomfortable to carry with you anywhere. The top doesnt close. It is like a box. No zipper or clips or buttons. It closes like a box. The shape of it is hurting your legs when you hold it....And it's just...so bulky.Would never buy it again.,2,-1
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Glass Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology and Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack","I bought these to use with my daughter, 4 months when she graduated to the next level of nipple and they do not work. Amazon will not refund us the entire order, simply replace. Do not use these if you are feeding your child formula or using the size 2 nipple. Lumps consistently block the hole and even when the hole is clear the formula does not come out smoothly unless you remove it from the babies mouth to allow air to enter the bottle. Sometimes it just doesn't flow no matter how hard she is sucking.Buy something else.",1,-1
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Glass Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology and Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack","My baby cannot drink from these bottles. Maybe the flow is too fast, but he keeps getting air, and almost choking, so he gets frustrated and pushes it out. So many times, i had to pour the milk in another bottle to be able to feed him. Now i am using the bottles only to warm the milk in the bottle warmer, because i wanted to use glass bottles for that.",2,-1

"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Glass Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology and Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack","I purchased one of these bottles for a friend as part of her baby shower gift.  After using the bottle one time, she was washing it and the glass on the bottom of the bottle cracked completely off!  Dangerous!  The bottle was not cold when she washed it, either.  I tried to return the item but Baby Haven refused as it had been past the 30 days since I purchased it (since the baby shower was a couple months out from her due date).  Now I have to try to file a claim from the manufacturer.  Such a hassle, and clearly a safety issue.  Be careful if you purchase these!",1,-1
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Glass Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology and Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack","I tried and tried to make these work since I really want to use the glass bottles, but the nipples just don't work for us. They are too big for my newborn's mouth -- she can get around the skinny 'nipple' part, but the 'areola' part is enormous. I don't know what happens but milk always leaks out and makes a mess (and it makes me want to cry watching breastmilk leak!). We tried at 5 weeks, then again at 8, then at 11 weeks.I don't know if another brand's nipple will work on the bottle.",2,-1
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Glass Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology and Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack","I like the actual bottle--it's glass, but isn't incredibly heavy. But what really annoys me is that the spouts to make the bottles into a trainer cup are expensive and difficult to find.  I also still can't find handles.  If Born Free really wanted to make this an environmentally way for parents to use their glass bottles as sippy cups later, they would have the spouts and handles easily available and reasonably priced.  I don't recommend purchasing unless you only want to use these as bottles.  I'm nearing the end of bottle feeding, and was hoping the conversion would justify my trying these bottles.",2,-1
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Glass Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology and Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack","First, the good: I like that these bottles are glass. They are great for warming milk in the Born Free bottle warmer. I'm not afraid of chemical leeching like with plastic bottles. LOVE that aspect.The bad: The level one nipple is a VERY fast flow. Even when the bottle is assembled correctly (which is VERY difficult), milk drips out quite freely as soon as the bottle is tipped. When the bottle is not assembled correctly (the top has to be screwed on not too tight and not too loose), milk squirts out like a fire hose! It usually takes me a few tries... put the lid on, tip the bottle, milk everywhere... tighten the lid a little more, tip the bottle, milk everywhere... loosen the lid, tip the bottle, milk everywhere... take the lid totally off, put it back on, tip the bottle, milk everywhere... tighten it a smidgen... you get the idea. It takes quite a few tries to find that sweet spot where the milk just drips out when the bottle is tipped instead of squirting everywhere.Even when I do find that sweet spot, my little man (2 months old) seems to have trouble keeping up with the flow. Milk runs down his chin, he sputters and coughs, I can hear him gulping frantically which causes lot of air intake, and we all know what that leads to. :-(I saw another post on here that said level one MAM nipples work much better as they are a slower flow nipple. I ordered those today, and have my fingers crossed. I REALLY want to love these bottles because they are glass, and they work wonderfully with the Born Free bottle warmer (which is AWESOME, by the way).**UPDATE** MAM nipples arrived, and they work MUCH better! I still have to find that ""sweet"" spot when I assemble these, but it is much easier to find now, and the MAM nipple offer a more appropriate slow flow for a newborn.",2,-1

Summer Infant Disney Winnie the Pooh Hunny Hive Bath Toy,"While I am a huge fan of Disney, and Winne the Pooh in particular, this toy really fell short at bathtime. The toy has to sit at the exact right angle in order for the flowing water to hit the spinner and make it spin. Even when it is suction cupped to the wall, most of the time the water doesn't make the spinner spin, which really frustrates my son.Also, I wish the spinner behind the bee was colored.

"Hudson Baby 2 Count Muslin Swaddle Blanket, Blue","My rating may be a little unfair because the blankets are fine - but I bought these solely because I loved the adorable sheep pattern.

I will post a picture so you can see what I'm talking about (and it actually shows up better in the picture than in real life).  I guess it's always possible mine was a fluke, but this was my experience.When compared to my Aden and Anais blankets, I have found these to be more scratchy, but they are also cheaper.  This isn't an issue for me, but I thought I would mention it.I love the big size of the blankets, and I would have given them 4 stars if I could have seen the sheep pattern like the product image depicted.",2,-1
